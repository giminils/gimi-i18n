  "school_story_9_screen_15_title": "Det virker kanskje urettferdig. Men vekslingskursene er alle litt ulike og er bestemt globalt. Slik at alle land er enige om dem",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_subtitle": "Du kan se på vekslingskursen som valutaen sin pris",
  "school_story_9_screen_15_button_1_title": "Ok",
  "school_story_10_screen_1_title": "Hei. Stopp opp et sekund. Jeg kom akkurat hjem fra jobb og jeg må finne brillene mine for å komme i rett læremodus!",

  "school_story_10_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg trodde dette var jobben din!",
  "school_story_10_screen_2_title": "Haha! Ja, jeg har en jobb! Å hjelpe deg med å få finansielle superkrefter gjør jeg fordi jeg syns det er morsomt! Og i tillegg fordi jeg syns det er viktig!",

  "school_story_10_screen_2_button_1_title": "Men sparegris, hva er jobben din da?",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_title": " UUhm... Du vet, jeg tror jeg holder det som en hemmelighet akkurat nå. Vil ikke at du skal vite alt om meg fra starten av. Jeg er hemmelighetsfull og mystisk på den måten...",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_subtitle": "Så. Å tjene. Er du med?",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_1_title": "Ja. Kom igjen!",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_2_title": "Antar det...",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_3_title": "Så klart!",
  "school_story_10_screen_3_button_4_title": "Du er ikke mystisk. Haha!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_title": "Vet du hva å tjene er?",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_subtitle": "Tipp!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_1_title": "Man får penger for å jobbe!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_2_title": "Å selge noe for mer penger enn man betalte!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_3_title": "Gjøre oppgaver og få betalt!",
  "school_story_10_screen_4_button_4_title": "Var det vanskelig å velge? Jeg lurte deg litt, fordi alle de svarene var riktig nemlig.",

  "school_story_10_screen_5_subtitle": "De er alle måter å tjene penger på!",
  "school_story_10_screen_5_button_1_title": "Du lurte meg!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_title": "Ja, beklager. Men det er et godt poeng om du ser det? Det fins mange måter å tjene penger på. Du vet sikkert at man kan få andre ting enn penger.",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_subtitle": "Du kan tjene penger, få berømmelse, en premie eller respekt! Men vi kommer bare til å snakke om å tjene penger.",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_1_title": "Du har skaffet deg min respekt!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_2_title": "Jeg tror jeg fikk litt berømmelse!",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_3_title": "Kan jeg få en premie nå?",
  "school_story_10_screen_6_button_4_title": "Jeg har lyst til å tjene penger!",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_title": "Tilbake til å lære hva penger egentlig er. Å tjene er å få noe i gjengjeld for jobben, arbeidsinnsatsen eller innsatsen du legger ned.",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_subtitle": "Det er på grunn av det at alle eksemplene i starten var sanne.",
  "school_story_10_screen_7_button_1_title": "Kan du minne meg på dem?",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_title": "Klart det, og jeg skal forklare mer hvorfor alt er å tjene penger. ",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_subtitle": "Du får en lønn når du jobber. Dette er kanskje det mest klare eksempelet. Samme er det når man får penger for å utføre en oppgave.",
  "school_story_10_screen_8_button_1_title": "JA, det er som en jobb for barn!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_title": "Ja, det er sant. Det er en veldig god måte å øve seg og lære at man faktisk må tjene penger. Man kan ikke bare få dem.",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_subtitle": "Når du får rente fra en sparekonto betyr det at du har gjort banken en tjeneste fordi du har lånt dem pengene dine. Og det er også en anstrengelse å spare!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ja, det er det!",
  "school_story_10_screen_9_button_2_title": "Det er enklere nå når du har forklart det",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_title": "Den siste er kanskje den som er vanskeligst å forstå i starten. Det var alternativet 'Selge noe for mer penger enn du betalte.’",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_subtitle": "For å gjøre det har du i en del tilfeller gjort noe som har gjort tingen bedre. Det er tiden og anstrengelsen du har lagt i det. Eller så har du lagt anstrengelse i å selge tingen også. Uansett måte så har du tjent ekstra penger!",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_button_1_title": "Jeg tror jeg forstår det",
  "school_story_10_screen_11_button_2_title": "Kult, kjør på",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_title": "Jeg tror du forstår hva å tjene penger er og kanskje til og med litt bedre nå. Og dette er en stor del av personlig økonomi!",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_subtitle": "Tre viktige ting for å være god på håndtering av egne penger er: Tjene, spare og bruke. Tjene er en veldig sentral del.",
  "school_story_10_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ja. Med ingen inntjening fins det ikke noe sparing eller forbruk!",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_title": "Der traff du spikeren på hue! Det er grunnen til at vi starter med tjene, men å være smart med alle vil sikre suksess.",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_subtitle": "De henger alle sammen skjønner du. Så smart inntjening, sparing og bruk er en farlig god kombinasjon.",
  "school_story_10_screen_13_button_1_title": "Syns jeg er smart når det kommer til forbruk",

  "school_story_10_screen_15_button_2_title": "Jeg vet det allerede. Jeg er sikker!",
  "school_story_10_screen_16_title": "Uansett hva du gjør så er det bra å starte tidlig. Da tenker jeg på øvelse. Gjør øvelser, kanskje hjelpe naboer?",

  "school_story_10_screen_18_title": "Det skjer, men om man skal være ærlig er det nok ikke noe du bør satse på... Take scrachers for example.",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_subtitle": "Visste du at sjansen for å vinne så mye penger er så lav at du kunne kjøpt en kupong hver dag for resten av livet ditt og ikke vinne en million?",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_button_1_title": "Hva? er det sant?",
  "school_story_10_screen_18_button_2_title": "Er du sikker..?",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_title": "Det er sant. Det kan bli regnet ut ved hjelp av mattematikk. Og om du hadde gjort det, for eksempel over 60 år, hadde du brukt litt over en halv million!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_subtitle": "Så jeg satser nok mer på å tjene. Flaks er fin, men god inntjening er sikkert og stabilt. Sparer du smart i stedet, med renter, vil du komme til å ha en million!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_1_title": "Det høres logisk ut! Og smart!",
  "school_story_10_screen_19_button_2_title": "Jeg må sjekke ut den mattematikken...",

  "school_story_12_screen_2_button_1_title": "Sparegris, jeg trodde du snakket om å tjene?",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_title": "Jeg gjør det. Men noen ganger er tipset om ren inntjening. Og noen ganger er det å tjene ved bruk eller å tjene ved sparing.",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_subtitle": "På spareplaneten for eksempel vil du lære at du kan tjene penger ved å spare ved bankrente eller bonus!",
  "school_story_12_screen_3_button_1_title": "Å tjene ved å bruke høres rart ut?",
  "school_story_12_screen_4_title": "Det høres rart ut. Jeg er enig i det men jeg skal forklare mer når jeg kommer til det tipset. La oss snakke mer om enkle tjenetips først.",
  "school_story_12_screen_4_button_1_title": "Ok, kom med det",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_title": "Tips nummer 1 er om å jobbe fordi det er den mest klassiske måten å tjene penger på. ‘Men hei Sparegris’, sier kanskje du. Jeg er gammel nok til å skaffe meg en jobb.",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_subtitle": "Det betyr ikke dermed at du kan jobbe og tjene penger! Fordi at om du gjør oppgaver og får betalt betyr det at du tjener penger!",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_button_1_title": " Da tjener jeg allerede!",
  "school_story_12_screen_5_button_2_title": "Kan jeg begynne å tjene på den måten?",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_title": " Ja! Så det første tipset er å sette opp noen oppgaver og kanskje se på hva foreldrene dine trenger hjelp med. Da kan du starte inntjeningen!",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_subtitle": "Om du vil kan du gjøre oppgaver hver uke for å ha en stabil inntekt, eller så kan du gjøre ulike ting ulike uker. Det er opp til deg og foreldrene dine.",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_button_1_title": "Jeg kommer til å bli rik!",
  "school_story_12_screen_6_button_2_title": "Gjør oppgaver allerede. Hvordan kan jeg tjene mer?",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_title": "Ok. så tips nr. 2 er å prøve å finne mer ting som du kan hjelpe til med utenfor hjemmet. Du kan jo for eksempel sjekke med besteforeldrene dine.",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_subtitle": "Om foreldrene dine syns det er ok kan du spørre naboene dine. Men sjekk med dem først. Det er ikke alltid en passende situasjon, der du kanskje bor i et nabolag der det ikke er ok.",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_button_1_title": "Høres ut som en god ide!",
  "school_story_12_screen_7_button_2_title": "Det høres skummelt ut",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_title": "Om du ikke vil gjøre det, kan du gjennomføre tips nr.3!",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_subtitle": "Du kan arrangere et loppemarked!",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_1_title": "Hva skulle jeg selge?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_2_title": "Hvor kunne jeg gjort det?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_3_title": "Hvordan?",
  "school_story_12_screen_8_button_4_title": "Jeg har gjort det!",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_title": "Det er ulike måter du kan gjøre det på. Først av alt må du ha noe å selge. Gå gjennom sakene dine og ta saker som du ikke bruker noe mer.",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_subtitle": "Det kan være klær, spill, leker eller alt egentlig. Men sjekk alltid med foreldrene dine. Og når du likavel spør dem kan du sjekke om de har noe de vil donere til hagesalget ditt!",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_button_1_title": "Jeg vet om noen ting jeg kan selge",
  "school_story_12_screen_9_button_2_title": "Jeg hører. Kjør på..",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_title": "Nå når du har noe å selge trenger du en måte å selge dem på! Om du har en hage eller innkjørsel kan du sette opp plakater ned tid og sted  i nabolaget eller på sosiale medier.",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_subtitle": "Men igjen... vær sikker på at foreldrene dine er hjemme og at de sier at det er ok. Da er du sikker!",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_button_1_title": "Men jeg har ingen hage",
  "school_story_12_screen_10_button_2_title": "Noen annen måte jeg kan gjøre det på?",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_title": "Du kan selge saker på nettet. Det er mange sosiale medier apper som har måter man kan gjøre det på eller vanlige salgssider på nettet.",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_subtitle": "Men vær forsiktig. Noen sider vil at du skal betale for å selge tingene dine! Det er også salgsapper du kan bruke. Vær sikker på at du har lest all informasjon og om det koster noe.",
  "school_story_12_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ååå, kult!",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_title": "Når du bruker internett til å selge ting er det viktig å tenke på hvordan person som kjøper det du selger skal få tak i produktet.",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_subtitle": "Skal de plukke det opp? Eller kommer du til å sende det? Du må planlegge det før du setter i gang.",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_button_1_title": "Åå, kanskje loppemarked er bedre..",
  "school_story_12_screen_13_button_2_title": "Ja, ingen problem!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_title": "Om du ikke har en hage eller innkjørsel der du kan selge tingene, men fortsatt vil gjøre et fysisk hagesalg, kan du sjekke annonsene for loppemarked.",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_subtitle": "Det fins mange loppemarkeder der du kan leie en plass til å selge tingene, og ofte fins det loppemarked for barn, bare for barn akkurat som deg selv!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_1_title": "Det høres morsomt ut!",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_2_title": "Jeg er litt for sjenert til det",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_3_title": "Jeg er for lat til det...",
  "school_story_12_screen_14_button_4_title": "Kanskje. Jeg skal tenke på det",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_title": "Jeg vil ikke gnage på deg, men når man selger ting (eller tjener, bruker eller sparer), er det viktig å sjekke med foreldrene dine.",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_subtitle": "Før du virkelig har finansielle superkrefter og blir litt eldre, er det viktig å be om tillatelse og lov av foreldrene, fordi det er fortsatt de som har ansvaret.",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_button_1_title": "Ja, det er sant...",
  "school_story_12_screen_15_button_2_title": "Ok, jeg skal det",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_title": "Mitt siste tips akkurat nå: Tips nummer 4 er et av de ‘tjene ved å bruke’ tipsene jeg snakket om.",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_subtitle": "Og det er jo et sparetips egentlig, men om du legger inn innsats kan det bli inntjening også!",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_button_1_title": "Høres rart ut fortsatt...",
  "school_story_12_screen_16_button_2_title": "Jeg forstår det!",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_title": "Så det handler om å tenke hardt, planlegge og sammenligne priser før du kjøper noe. Og kanskje til og med vente til det er salg.",
  "school_story_12_screen_17_subtitle": "La oss si at du har et sparemål du setter deg opp. Du sparer til å kjøpe en...",

  "school_story_12_screen_18_subtitle": "Du kan begynne med å sammenligne priser i ulike butikker. Når du vet hvilke hodetelefoner du vil ha, kan du sjekke hvilken butikk som har den beste prisen.",
  "school_story_12_screen_18_button_1_title": "Det høres veldig smart ut",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_title": "Det er veldig smart. Noen ganger kan det spare deg for flere hundre kroner! Og om du er tolmodig og ekstra utspekulert kan vil du planlegge til det er salg...",
  "school_story_12_screen_19_subtitle": "Planlegg å kjøpe dem når det er store salg, som black friday i november, eller julesalg. Ellers kan du vente til du har spart opp nok til et salg dukker opp.",

  "school_story_12_screen_19_button_4_title": "Jeg gjør alltid det!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_title": "Det er sant. Det kan vere tøft å gjøre, men om du treffer på et veldig bra salg kan du spare veldig mye! Om hodetelefoner koster 1000pb og du sparer deg opp så mye",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_subtitle": "Om du venter på et salg så kan du kanskje kjøpe dem for 700pb og da har du 300pb igjen! Og selv om det kanskje krevde en innsats kan du faktisk si at du tjente dem!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_1_title": "Jeg skal prøve på det!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_2_title": "Kanskje jeg forsøker...",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_3_title": "Tenkte ikke på det på den måten!",
  "school_story_12_screen_20_button_4_title": "Det er ganske mye!",
  "school_story_12_screen_21_title": "Jeg lar deg tenke litt på dette. Du har forhåpentligvis en hel masse ting å prøve ut for å forsøke å tjene penger nå!",

  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_3_title": "Spare er viktig",
  "school_story_13_screen_1_button_4_title": "Jeg sparer mye",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_title": "Før vi begynner på sparing vil jeg forklare et annet ord til deg! Du vet hva et produkt er. Det er en ting du kan kjøpe. Men hva med noe du kan kjøpe som ikke er en ting?",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_subtitle": "Det blir kalt en tjeneste. Som Netflix som er en strømmetjeneste. Eller om du reiser til en butikk og ber dem fikse den ødelagte skjermen på telefonen din. Da kjøper du en tjeneste. Så du kan kjøpe et produkt eller en tjeneste!",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_1_title": "Ok, jeg forstår!",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_2_title": "Flott",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_3_title": "Jeg visste det",
  "school_story_13_screen_2_button_4_title": "Jeg visste ikke det!",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_title": "Du vet sikkert allerede hva sparing betyr, men jeg tenkte at jeg skulle forklare det litt grundigere.",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_subtitle": "Sparer du noen penger?",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_button_1_title": "Ja, det gjør jeg!",
  "school_story_13_screen_3_button_2_title": "Nei, det gjør jeg ikke",
  "school_story_13_screen_4_title": "Om du gjør det er det flott. Om du ikke gjør det bør du starte med det! Sparing er vanligvis en veldig enkel sak. Det betyr bare at du må beholde mer enn du bruker.",
  "school_story_13_screen_4_subtitle": "Husker du i starten når folk brukte mynter? Folk som hadde problem med å bære med seg alle myntene sine. De hadde så mye fordi de hadde tjent og spart mye.",

  "school_story_13_screen_5_title": "Du kan se det tydlig når du sparer sedler og mynter i sparegrisen hjemme, men også når du sparer i sparegrisen i Gimi appen. Det vokser hver gang du sparer i steden for å bruke!",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_subtitle": "Det er veldig enkel matte. Noe som du helt sikkert lærte i de første skoleårene på skolen. Enkel addering og subtraksjon. ",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_button_1_title": "Ja, jeg har lært det allerede!",
  "school_story_13_screen_5_button_2_title": "Nei, jeg har ikke gått på skolen ennå",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_title": "Så da vet du trolig at alt kan bli addert og subtrahert på samme måte. Det har ingenting å si om det er epler, iphone-er eller penger.",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_subtitle": "La oss se om du husker hva ordene jeg bruker betyr... hva er addering?",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_1_title": "Det er når du summerer ting",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_2_title": "Det er når du trekker fra ting",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_3_title": "Det er når du deler",
  "school_story_13_screen_6_button_4_title": "Det er når du spiser eplene",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_title": "Det er når du summerer ting! Om du har 5 epler, du legger til 2, da får du 7. Det er kalt addisjon i mattematikken.",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_subtitle": "Og hva er subtraksjon?",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_1_title": "Det er når du summerer ting",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_2_title": "Det er når du trekker fra ting",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_3_title": "Det er når du deler",
  "school_story_13_screen_7_button_4_title": "Det er når du spiser eplene",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_title": "Det er når du trekker fra ting, eller subtraherer ting! Om du har 5 epler og tar bort 2 har du 3 epler igjen. Det blir kalt subtraksjon i mattematikken.",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_button_1_title": "Jaja, jeg vet alt dette!",
  "school_story_13_screen_8_button_2_title": "Takk for påminningen!",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_title": "Jeg vet at dette kanskje virker veldig enkelt for deg, men jeg ville forklare det bare for sikkerhets skyld.",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_subtitle": "Vil også påpeke og få deg til å forstå at man bruker mattematikk til å telle alt når det kommer til penger og økonomi pluss å forstå at ting henger sammen. Ofte veldig enkel matte.",
  "school_story_13_screen_9_button_1_title": "Du sa at sparing er viktig?",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_title": "Ja, la oss gå tilbake til det. Jeg forklarte matteordene fordi du kan forklare det bra med mattematikk.",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_subtitle": "Du bør aldri bruke mer penger enn du har, sant?",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_button_1_title": "Det er sant!",
  "school_story_13_screen_10_button_2_title": "Hvorfor?",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_title": "Å svare på hvorfor du ikke bør bruke mer enn du har er her addisjon og subtraksjon kommer inn.",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_subtitle": "Om du har de 5 eplene, da har du bare 5 epler. Du kan ikke spise mer enn 5 epler, fordi du har ikke mer.",
  "school_story_13_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ja",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_title": "Men om det gjelder penger så kan man noen ganger bruke mer enn man har på bankkontoen. Da får du en negativ balanse på kontoen din.",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_subtitle": "Det er ikke bra.",
  "school_story_13_screen_13_button_1_title": "Hvorfor er ikke det bra?",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_title": "Det er ikke bra fordi at når du bruker mer enn du faktisk har låner du penger fra banken. Eller fra noen andre. Alle lån koster penger på samme måte som du ville kjøpt et produkt eller en tjeneste.",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_subtitle": "Altså betyr dette at du har mindre enn du startet med og at du må betale tilbake. I tillegg må du tjene mer for å ha litt penger igjen.",
  "school_story_13_screen_14_button_1_title": "Vis meg med mattematikk!",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_title": "Ok! Så du har 5pb. Om du bruker 7pb på en sjokolade, betyr det at du måtte lånt 2pb fra banken.",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_subtitle": "5-7= -2",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_button_1_title": "Ser rett ut",
  "school_story_13_screen_15_button_2_title": "Dette er så enkel matte!",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_title": "Neste uke vil du kanskje kjøpe noe annet for 3pb. Men du har ingen penger og du skylder banken 2pb. Og om du har lånt fra banken koster dette lånet penger også.",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_subtitle": "Lån fra banker eller andre utlånere er en tjeneste du må betale for. Så nå skylder du banken de 2pb som du lånte, og kostanden for lånet er 50 øre. Om du fortsatter med å gå i minus og bruker masse vil du til slutt ende opp med gjeld.",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_button_1_title": "Gjeld?",
  "school_story_13_screen_16_button_2_title": "Høres ikke bra ut?",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_title": "Det er ikke bra. Jeg skal forklare dette på en annen planet med hva som skjer om du har et overforbruk og ender opp i stor gjeld som det er kaltIt is bad. Du må vite det!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_subtitle": "Med å spare kan du sikre deg at du har penger når du vil bruke penger og forsikre deg om at du ikke har en negativ balanse!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_button_1_title": "Fortell mer!",
  "school_story_13_screen_17_button_2_title": "Ja. Fortell meg!",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_title": "Fordi ved å spare legger du til istedenfor å trekke fra.",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_subtitle": "Så klart er forbruk nødvendig og noe du skal gjøre. Men du bør bruke pengene smart. Og en måte å gjøre det på er å spare opp til ting på forhånd.",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_button_1_title": "Høres logisk ut",
  "school_story_13_screen_18_button_2_title": "Jeg vil vite mer!",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_title": "La meg vise deg med matte igjen. La oss si at du har de samme 5pb. Du sparer 3pb hver uke i 3 uker.",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_subtitle": "5+3+3+3=14",
  "school_story_13_screen_19_button_1_title": "Ser rett ut",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_title": "Nå har du 14pb. Om du vil kjøpe en sjokolade for 7pb har du 7pb igjen etter kjøpet.",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_subtitle": "Du har fortsatt penger igjen og må ikke låne for å betale avgifter for lån!",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_1_title": "Sparing virker bra!",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_2_title": "Det høres bedre ut",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_3_title": "Jeg er fortsatt forvirret",
  "school_story_13_screen_20_button_4_title": "Men jeg liker ikke sparing",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_title": "Det er derfor er sparing er viktig. Å bruke mer enn du har er dyrt og kan skaffe en del problem.",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_subtitle": "Vær alltid sikker på at du har litt penger oppspart. Å ha en buffer er veldig smart når det kommer til penger og det er en finansiell superkraft!",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_button_1_title": "Jeg skal prøve!",
  "school_story_13_screen_21_button_2_title": "Ok, jeg vil ha finansielle superkrefter",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_title": "Ja, så for å summere opp denne destinasjonen take-away beskjed:",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_subtitle": "Enkelt forklart: enkel sparing er å legge penger unna og la summen du har vokse over tid og tjene mer enn du bruker.",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_1_title": "Har det!",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_2_title": "Ja",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_3_title": "Jeg tror jeg forstår!",
  "school_story_13_screen_22_button_4_title": "Forstår det nesten nå...",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_title": "Hei, bra jobb på utfordringen! Jeg satt faktisk å sorterte sparepengene mine.",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_subtitle": "Jeg har gjort litt gjennvinning og hjelpt til i nabolaget så jeg tjener penger!",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_button_1_title": "Jeg gjør det ibland også",
  "school_story_14_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg har ikke tjent penger ennå...",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_title": "Ok. Som du lærte på planeten om å tjene er det supert!",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_subtitle": "Jeg elsker å spare penger som jeg tjener. Jeg kan se dem vokse akkurat som en plante!",
  "school_story_14_screen_2_button_1_title": "Det er bra når penger vokser!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_title": "Og når jeg har et sparemål og kan se at jeg kommer nærmere målet føles det bra.",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_subtitle": "Nå må jeg bare bestemme hvordan jeg skal spare pengene jeg har tjent. Jeg tjente 200pb!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_button_1_title": "Bra jobb Sparegris!",
  "school_story_14_screen_3_button_2_title": "God innsats!",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_title": "Jeg har sett på et romskip en stund.... Det er som et vanlig romskip men det har sin egen atmosfære.",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_subtitle": "Da trenger du ikke bruke romdrakt når du flyr i det. Og det lager den kuleste blup blup lyd....",
  "school_story_14_screen_4_button_1_title": "Høres kult ut, men hva med sparingen?",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_title": "Stemmer! Sorry! Så jeg kommer tilbake til romskipet. Så først vil jeg prøve å fortelle deg mer om hvorfor sparing er så viktig.",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_button_1_title": "Supert. Kjør!",
  "school_story_14_screen_5_button_2_title": "Jeg vil ha et romskip også!",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_title": "Jeg forklarte tidligere at sparing er veldig viktig så du ikke ender opp med et overforbruk.",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_subtitle": "Fordi det gjør ting du kjøper dyrere, så kan det bli vanskelig å komme seg på rett spor igjen om det først går feil vei.",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_button_1_title": "Ja, fordi å låne penger koster penger",
  "school_story_14_screen_6_button_2_title": "Jeg husker det. Jeg skal spare i stedet",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_title": "Det er faktisk den viktigste tingen når det kommer til sparing. Men det er også sant at du kan få mer penger av å spare!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_1_title": "Jasså? Fortell meg hvordan!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_2_title": "Jeg vet dette!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_3_title": "Interessant. Fortell meg mer!",
  "school_story_14_screen_7_button_4_title": "Jeg starter nå!",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_title": "Når du sparer penger i en bank i det som blir kalt en sparekonto, får du rente.",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_subtitle": "Rente er en prosent av pengene banken gir deg for å ha pengene i banken.",
  "school_story_14_screen_8_button_1_title": "Vent. Banken gir meg penger?",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_title": "Du kan si det sånn. Det som egentlig skjer er at når du har pengene dine i banken, er det faktisk et lån banken har hos deg.",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_subtitle": "Og banken betaler deg for det lånet med en rente på pengene dine. Så til lenger du har dem der og mer du sparer, desto mer vil du tjene!",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_button_1_title": "Det høres bra ut!",
  "school_story_14_screen_9_button_2_title": "Det virker risikabelt?",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_title": "Bankene garanterer at du vil få pengene tilbake på din vanlige sparekonto. Men vanligvis sperrer man pengene for en periode og etter det får du alt tilbake + rente!",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_subtitle": "Det fins andre måter å spare på der det fins en risk for å tape på samme tid, men som vil gi mer rente.",
  "school_story_14_screen_10_button_1_title": "Jeg vil tjene mer. Fortell meg hvordan!",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_title": "La oss vente litt med det. Det er litt andre ting du må vite først.",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_subtitle": "Det fins mange ulike måter å spare på, men generelt kan man dele inn i langtidssparing eller korttidssparing.",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ok, land tid og kort tid",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_2_title": "Ja, jeg forstår det!",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_3_title": "Hva er langtidssparing?",
  "school_story_14_screen_12_button_4_title": "Hva er korttidssparing?",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_title": "La oss starte med korttidssparing. ",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_subtitle": "Den enkleste måten når det kommer til korttidssparing er å legge unna penger og prøve å ikke bruke dem.",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_button_1_title": "Høres for enkelt ut",
  "school_story_14_screen_13_button_2_title": "Men det er ganske vanskelig",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_title": "Det kan være ganske vanskelig! Men på den måten sikrer du deg at du har penger til ting du virkelig trenger eller vil ha!.",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_subtitle": "Pengene forsvinner fort når du kjøper en brus her og en iskrem der...",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_button_1_title": "Jeg merket det!",
  "school_story_14_screen_14_button_2_title": "Jeg vet. Det er derfor jeg sparer!",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_title": "En annen måte som kommer under korttidssparing er når du sparer til noe som ikke er så dyrt.",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_subtitle": "Så du sparer pengene dine, men kanskje ikke på en sparekonto fordi du ikke ønsker å låse dem.",
  "school_story_14_screen_15_button_1_title": "Jeg forstår!",
  "school_story_14_screen_16_title": "Langtidssparing er som du kanskje har pønsket uu, når du sparer lenge.",
  "school_story_14_screen_16_button_1_title": "Ja, enkelt",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_title": "Langtidssparing kan være ulik lengde på. For eksempel når du sparer til noe veldig dyrt, som en smarttelefon.",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_subtitle": "Det ville tatt litt tid å spare seg opp til det. Kanskje til og med noen år om du ikke tjener ekstra med penger. Så fins det langtidssparing som kanskje varer hele livet ditt!",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_button_1_title": "Oi, det var lenge!",
  "school_story_14_screen_17_button_2_title": "Jeg har spart i mange år allerede!",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_title": "Ja, sparing bør aldri slutte. Den beste mixen er å ha balanse mellom korttids- og langtidssparing.",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_subtitle": "Og du behøver ikke tenke på de virkelig lange sparingene ennå. Men når du blir voksen bør du starte så tidlig som mulig.",
  "school_story_14_screen_18_button_1_title": "Ups, det var bra",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_title": "Ok, jeg har bestemt meg. Jeg vil dele pengene jeg har spart i både korttids- og langtidssparing!",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_subtitle": "Jeg tjente 200pb sant? Jeg vil legge 150pb på langtiddsparing for å kunne kjøpe et romskip.",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_1_title": "Bare 150pb?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_2_title": "Hvorfor ikke alle 200pb?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_3_title": "Så mye?",
  "school_story_14_screen_19_button_4_title": "Men da har du 50pb igjen",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_title": "Ja, jeg vil spare de 50pb på korttidssparing sånn at jeg har litt igjen å bruke.",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_subtitle": "Men bare når jeg må. Jeg har lyst på sjokolade akkurat nå, men jeg skipper det. Jeg sparer dem.",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_button_1_title": "Høres lurt ut",
  "school_story_14_screen_20_button_2_title": "Høres vanskelig ut",
  "school_story_14_screen_21_title": "Jeg skal gå og gjøre det med en gang. Gå og øv deg i utfordringen så skal jeg lære deg smarte måter å spare på i neste historie!",
  "school_story_14_screen_21_button_1_title": "Ok, ha det",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_title": "Om jeg husker rett så lovte jeg å lære deg mer om sparing, eller mer spesifikke og utspekulerte måter å gjøre det på?",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_button_1_title": "Ja, sånn var det!",
  "school_story_15_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg husker ikke. Utfordringen ødela det",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_title": "Vi var igjennom langtidssparing og korttidssparingWe went through long- and short term savings, men jeg tror jeg nevnte noe om en sparebuffer..?",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_button_1_title": "Ja, og jeg er nyskjerrig",
  "school_story_15_screen_2_button_2_title": "Nei..? Fortell meg det da!",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_title": "Haha, beklager. Jeg er litt sliten. Jeg telte pengene mine til sent i går kveld...",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_subtitle": "Ok. Glem nå det. Sparebuffer er emnet. En buffer er et slags lager. Innenfor økonomi betyr det at du sparer opp et lager, eller buffer av penger.",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_1_title": "Er min sparegris en buffer?",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_2_title": "Hmmm... Jeg må vite mer",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_3_title": "Jeg tror jeg har en sparekonto",
  "school_story_15_screen_3_button_4_title": "Jeg har ikke en. Jeg har brukt det",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_title": "Sparegrisen din kan være en sparebuffer. Det kommer an på om du har penger spart. Mer enn du bruker.",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_subtitle": "En sparebuffer er ofte det korttidssparingen du lærte om i forrige historie, faktisk er.",
  "school_story_15_screen_4_button_1_title": "Men hva var det til for nå igjen?",
  "school_story_15_screen_5_title": "Som jeg sa : Det er når du sparer mer enn du bruker. Du sparer det til 'regnværsdager'’",
  "school_story_15_screen_5_button_1_title": "Hva er forskjellen fra korttidssparing?",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_title": "Forskjellen er at du sparer ikke til noe spesielt. Du sparer bare i tilfelle noe skulle dukke opp.",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_subtitle": "Det er veldig viktig som voksen ettersom ting som er dyre kan gå i stykker. Som for eksempel en bil eller varmekildene i huset der du bor.",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_button_1_title": "Ok, jeg forstår!",
  "school_story_15_screen_6_button_2_title": "Coolio",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_title": "Om bilen går i stykker og den er dyr å reparere er det ikke sikkert du har råd til å fikse den etter at du har betalt regningene dine.",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_subtitle": "Men du må fikse den fordi ellers kommer du deg ikke til jobben! Om du har en sparebuffer med ekstra penger har du det du trenger uten å ødelegge budsjettet ditt.",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_1_title": "Men jeg er ikke en voksen...",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_2_title": "Jeg tror ikke jeg trenger en buffer?",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_3_title": "Jeg starter med det når jeg blir voksen",
  "school_story_15_screen_7_button_4_title": "Så jeg kan bruke nå?",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_title": "Men det er viktig for alle! Til og med barn.. også kule barn som du. For det første er det som med all økonomi og pengespørsmål veldig viktig å trene tidlig.",
  "school_story_15_screen_8_subtitle": "Disse pengespørsmålene er vanskelig for voksne også så til tidligere du skaffer deg gode vaner til bedre blir det for deg! Det gjelder alle økonomiske superkrefter!",

  "school_story_15_screen_8_button_2_title": "Ååå, ok",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_title": "For det andre kan det være saker du må betale for som du ikke forventet. La oss si at du akkurat fikk en ny smarttelefon.",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_subtitle": "Du mister den og skjermen knuser. Foreldrene dine forteller deg at du burde tatt bedre vare på denr og at du må betale for den selv.",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_1_title": "😱",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_2_title": "🤯",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_3_title": "😬",
  "school_story_15_screen_9_button_4_title": "😭",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_title": "Hvis du ikke har en sparebuffer må du spare lenge for å få reparert skjermen. Det er ganske dyrt!",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_subtitle": "Og... hmmm. Kanskje du da også ville kjøpt en skjermbeskytter?",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_button_1_title": "Ja, helt sikkert",
  "school_story_15_screen_10_button_2_title": "Jeg måtte spare i flere måneder!",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_title": "Ja, hva om du hadde en sparebuffer? Hvis bufferen er stor kan det gå fortere til du har råd til å reparere skjermen.",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_subtitle": "Eller hvis den er stor nok, har du kanskje råd til det med en gang! Da går du ikke rundt så lenge med en knust skjerm...",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_1_title": "Høres bra ut",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_2_title": "Smart!",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_3_title": "Jeg tror jeg må begynne å spare",
  "school_story_15_screen_12_button_4_title": "Neeeei...",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_title": "La meg fortelle deg om noen smarte måter og triks som kan hjelpe deg å spare mer!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_subtitle": "Mitt første tips handler om bonus! Som barn kan det være vanskelig å få kontoer og renter fra banken. Men i Gimi-appen kan du få bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_button_1_title": "Jeg elsker triks!",
  "school_story_15_screen_13_button_2_title": "Hva er bonus?",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_title": "Bonus fungerer som renter. Men foreldrene dine betaler det for pengene du sparer i din Gimi-sparegris!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_subtitle": "Du kan avtale og diskutere med foreldrene dine hva bonusen skal være, og når du får uke-/månedspenger får du ekstra penger!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_button_1_title": "Jeg vil ha bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_14_button_2_title": "Jeg har bonus",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_title": "Om du husker det, er renten en liten prosent du får av banken, og bonus fungerer på samme måte. La oss si at du har 100pb i sparegrisen din.",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_subtitle": "Hvis du har en bonus på 0,05%, vil du etter uke/-månedspengen ha 5kr ekstra, bare i bonus!",
  "school_story_15_screen_15_button_1_title": "Å spare penger lønner seg virkelig!",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_title": "Jepp! Mitt andre tips er noe som kalles matchet sparing. Det er veldig enkelt, det er å spare litt selv og få samme beløp i tillegg.",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_subtitle": "Du kan spørre foreldrene dine eller et annet familiemedlem og se om de ønsker å lage en avtale for å oppmuntre deg og hjelpe deg i sparingen. Kanskje hvis du sparer 100, så vil de gi deg 100?",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_button_1_title": "Jeg kan prøve",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_button_2_title": "Nei, det virker som mye jobb",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_title": "Jeg vet ikke, det avhenger av familien din, husk å spørre på en hyggelig måte. De må ikke gjøre det.",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_subtitle": "Ok, så et annet triks er å sette seg et sparemål. Faktisk har jeg sett at barn som bruker målkartet i appen og setter seg sparemål er flinkere til å spare!",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_1_title": "Hva? Virkelig?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_2_title": "Hvorfor?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_3_title": "Jeg bruker den, er jeg flinkere til å spare?",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_button_4_title": "Hvordan fungerer det?",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_title": "Det er sant! Forskerne kan ikke si sikkert hvorfor, men de gjetter at det er fordi det er motiverende å se at pengene vokser!",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_subtitle": "Så hvis du ikke bruker det og ønsker å bli bedre til å spare, bruk målkartet! Eller lag ditt eget mål! Den viktige delen er å sette et sparemål og følge med på hvordan det går underveis.",
  "school_story_15_screen_18_button_1_title": "Ok, kult. Flere tips eller triks?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_title": "Ja, jeg har et siste, og dette kan du gjøre helt selv! Det kalles 'opprundingsmetode’.",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_subtitle": "Det er et triks der du alltid legger bort eller sparer litt penger når du kjøper ting.",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_1_title": "Vent, hva?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_2_title": "Hvordan fungerer det?",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_3_title": "Jeg kjenner denne!",
  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_4_title": "...ved å runde opp?",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_title": "Det er også enkelt, og en måte å lure seg selv til å spare ofte - men bare litt. Du vet hva de sier: 'mange bekker små gjør en stor å', hver krone teller!",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_subtitle": "Så hver gang du kjøper noe runder du opp til nærmeste 10, eller hva du enn bestemmer deg for, og du legger bort differansen til sparepenger.",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_button_1_title": "Jeg tror jeg forstår...",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_button_2_title": "Kan du gi et eksempel?",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_title": "Ok, et eksempel er at du kjøper en is som koster 35pb. Hvis du runder opp til nærmeste 10 er det 40pb. Differansen er 5pb. De 5 kronene legger du i sparepengene dine.",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_subtitle": "Eller hvis du kjøper en lue og betaler 349pb runder du opp til 350. Differansen er 1pb, så du sparer det.",
  "school_story_15_screen_21_button_1_title": "Virker som om jeg ville spare veldig lite?",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_title": "Ja det er litt hver gang, men det er enkelt, og du merker det ikke så mye. Og du gjør det mange ganger, så det samler seg opp! Det blir på en måte å lure deg selv til å spare. Og alt du kan spare er flott!",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_subtitle": "Ok, jeg tror du er klar for utfordringen! Du må prøve et av triksene!",
  "school_story_15_screen_22_button_1_title": "Ok, nå går jeg!",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_title": "Nå går vi ut og handler. Nei, beklager. Jeg må bli her med katten Fido. Hun hater folkemengder...",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_subtitle": "...og merkelig nok lukten av penger som brukes opp. Merkelig katt!",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_1_title": "Veldig rar!",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_2_title": "Sparsom katt, da?",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_3_title": "Heter hun virkelig Fido?",
  "school_story_16_screen_1_button_4_title": "Katten kan hjelpe deg med å spare!",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_title": "Men, hør her! Nå skal vi snakke om å bruke penger og forskjellige måter å betale på.",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_subtitle": "Ja, jeg tror jeg starter som vanlig; med et spørsmål! Hva betyr det å bruke?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_1_title": "Bruke opp noe?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_2_title": "Bli kvitt penger?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_3_title": "Kjøpe ting?",
  "school_story_16_screen_2_button_4_title": "Jeg er ikke sikker",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_title": "Det kan være vanskelig å forklare når du ikke spesifiserer hva du snakker om, fordi du kan bruke mye annet enn penger.",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_subtitle": "Du kan bruke tid. Og du kan bruke sommeren til å hvile hjernen din. Og selvfølgelig bruker du penger.",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_button_1_title": "Ja! Flott måte å bruke sommeren på!",
  "school_story_16_screen_3_button_2_title": "Jeg liker å bruke hjernen!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_title": "Ordet bruke betyr 'å bruke noe med den forståelse at det kan ta slutt'. Noe som passer veldig godt for penger!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_subtitle": "Hvis du bare bruker penger, vil de ta slutt. Det er nettopp derfor du tjener og sparer også: for å kunne bruke penger uten at de tar slutt!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_1_title": "Ja! Nå forstår jeg!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_2_title": "Ah, forstår bedre nå",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_3_title": "Jeg har visst dette lenge!",
  "school_story_16_screen_4_button_4_title": "Å, jeg må tenke på dette",
  "school_story_16_screen_5_title": "Hvis du også bruker pengene smart, vil de vare lengre og til flere ting!",
  "school_story_16_screen_5_button_1_title": "Så god deal!",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_title": "Det du gjør når du bruker penger er at du betaler for ting. Det kan være at du kjøper ting du ønsker deg eller betaler regninger som er nødvendige.",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_subtitle": "Det er derfor jeg tenkte at du trenger å vite om forskjellige måter å betale på og hvordan de fungerer.",
  "school_story_16_screen_6_button_1_title": "Det virker lurt",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_title": "I dag er nesten alle pengene våre digitale, og det betyr at vi har mange løsninger for hvordan vi kan betale.",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_subtitle": "Jeg kan nevne noen. Du kan betale med telefonen på flere måter, som Vipps eller Apple Pay. Du kan til og med betale med smartklokken din!",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_button_1_title": "Jeg tenker ikke på hvor mange det er!",
  "school_story_16_screen_7_button_2_title": "Jeg har brukt flere av dem",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_title": "På stoppene på denne planeten skal vi snakke om de mer klassiske måtene du kan betale på.",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_subtitle": "Dette gjør vi fordi de nye digitale løsningene alle er basert på dem.",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_1_title": "Ah, ok!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_2_title": "Visste ikke det!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_3_title": "Jepp!",
  "school_story_16_screen_8_button_4_title": "Nå vil jeg vite mer",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_title": "For eksempel kan du betale med Apple Pay fordi du har lagt inn informasjonen fra bankkortet ditt ...",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_subtitle": "...hvis du vil være pirkete, så betaler du faktisk med kortet ditt, men via telefonen. Så det er den måten du må forstå først.",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_button_1_title": "Jeg lærer faktisk mye nytt",
  "school_story_16_screen_9_button_2_title": "Jeg har kontroll på det meste",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_title": "Ok, da starter vi med å gå gjennom ulike typer kort du kan betale med og viktige forskjeller og likheter mellom dem.",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_subtitle": "For å bruke penger smart er det viktig å velge riktige betalingsmåter.",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_1_title": "Enkelt",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_2_title": "Det vet jeg allerede",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_3_title": "Det virker ikke vanskelig",
  "school_story_16_screen_10_button_4_title": "Ok, kjør!",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_title": "Å betale med kort høres kanskje enkelt ut, men vet du hva som faktisk skjer når du tæpper et kort eller taster inn kortnummeret når du handler på nett?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ærlig talt, nei",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_2_title": "Penger forsvinner vel?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_3_title": "Får banken et varsel?",
  "school_story_16_screen_12_button_4_title": "Jeg blir fattig",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_title": "Svaret er egentlig at det er litt forskjellig hva som skjer. For det avhenger av hvilken type kort du har. Se! Det er allerede mer komplisert enn du tror.",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_subtitle": "De fire vanligste korttypene er forhåndsbetalte kort, bankkort, kredittkort og debetkort.",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_button_1_title": "Ok, jeg visste ikke om alle",
  "school_story_16_screen_13_button_2_title": "Wow, så mange forskjellige",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_title": "Vi tar dem i tur og orden. Jeg kan starte med å nevne at forhåndsbetalte kort og bankkort er veldig like.",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_subtitle": "De er begge kort hvor du må ha penger før du kan betale med kortet. Begge fungerer som en moderne og digital versjon av en gammel lommebok.",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_button_1_title": "Gammel? Lommeboken min er ny!",
  "school_story_16_screen_14_button_2_title": "Ok... Fortsett",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_title": "Går du på butikken med lommebok og må betale med kontanter, må du ha penger i lommeboka.",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_subtitle": "Når du handler kan du bare kjøpe ting så lenge du har nok penger igjen.",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_button_1_title": "Jeg skjønner, fin sammenligning",
  "school_story_16_screen_15_button_2_title": "Mmm, kan du fortelle meg mer?",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_title": "Når lommeboken er tom er den tom, ikke sant? Da har du brukt alt.",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_subtitle": "Og akkurat det samme gjelder for forhåndsbetalte kort og bankkort.",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_button_1_title": "Enig om hvordan de er like",
  "school_story_16_screen_16_button_2_title": "Men hvordan er de forskjellige da",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_title": "La meg fortelle deg mer om hvordan det første og enkleste kortet fungerer.",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_subtitle": "Forhåndsbetalte kortet, eller Prepaid-kart som det også ofte kalles, ser ut som et vanlig kort.",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_1_title": "Hvordan ser et uvanlig kort ut?",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_2_title": "Bankkorttype da, eller?",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_3_title": "Ja, jeg har sett dem",
  "school_story_16_screen_17_button_4_title": "Jeg tror jeg har en",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_title": "Men det fungerer som et gavekort eller busskort, fordi du må 'lade' det med penger før du bruker det.",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_subtitle": "Har du hørt om slike kort før?",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_button_1_title": "Nix!",
  "school_story_16_screen_18_button_2_title": "Jepp!",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_title": "Forhåndsbetalte kort er faktisk mer vanlig enn man kanskje tror, spesielt blant barn og unge.",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_subtitle": "Foreldre betaler penger på kortet, f.eks. ukepenger eller julegavepenger og så handler du! Så det er det samme som å få penger i hånden, bare digitalt!",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_button_1_title": "Aha, nå er jeg med",
  "school_story_16_screen_19_button_2_title": "Jeg har et sånn kort!",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_title": "Gimi-kortet, som foreldre i Sverige kan bestille til barna sine i appen, fungerer akkurat sånn. Det er et forhåndsbetalt kort du kan handle med.",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_subtitle": "Mange slike kort er knyttet til en app hvor du kan holde styr på saldoen, altså hvor mye penger du har igjen.",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_button_1_title": "Jeg henger med!",
  "school_story_16_screen_20_button_2_title": "Mye å holde styr på",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_title": "Og balansen bør du holde øye med! For hvis pengene er borte, er det ikke mulig å handle med kortet!",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_subtitle": "Nå sender jeg deg avgårde for å gjøre utfordringen. Jeg skal forklare på neste stopp, men vet du hva balansen er?",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_button_1_title": "Nei jeg vet ikke",
  "school_story_16_screen_21_button_2_title": "Hvor mye penger det er på kortet",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_title": "Håper det gikk bra og at du fikk øvd deg litt på det du lærte!",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_subtitle": "Det siste vi snakket om før utfordringen var det forhåndsbetalte kortet",
  "school_story_17_screen_1_button_1_title": "Det er riktig!",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_title": "Og hvor viktig det er å holde styr på balansen. Og det er hvor mye penger som er på kortet akkurat når du sjekker. Hvor mye penger du har på en konto kalles også en saldo.",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_subtitle": "Og det var viktig å holde styr på for å...",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_1_title": "Kunne handle uten penger på kortet",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_2_title": "Oversikt er bra å ha",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_3_title": "Vet ikke",
  "school_story_17_screen_2_button_4_title": "Kunne få mer penger",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_title": "Svaret er at det ikke er mulig å handle dersom saldoen er for lav. Det samme gjelder bankkortet, kjøpet går ikke igjennom som det heter.",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_subtitle": "Det gjelder alle kort hvor man må ha penger før man kan betale med kortene.",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_button_1_title": "Jeg husker det!",
  "school_story_17_screen_3_button_2_title": "Nå skal jeg nok huske det",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_title": "Forskjellen på et forhåndsbetalt kort og et bankkort er at bankkortet ikke har penger på seg, men er knyttet til en konto i banken.",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_subtitle": "Og det er på kontoen pengene står.",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_button_1_title": "Jeg er med!",
  "school_story_17_screen_4_button_2_title": "Jepp",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_title": "Fordi bankkortet er knyttet til kontoen, blir pengene trukket fra kontoen når du bruker det i butikken eller på nett.",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_subtitle": "Men noen må helt klart betale pengene inn på kontoen først, ellers blir saldoen 0!",
  "school_story_17_screen_5_button_1_title": "Foreldrene mine!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_title": "Prøver du å handle med et forhåndsbetalt kort eller et bankkort når pengene går tom, vil det dukke opp en feilmelding på kortautomaten i butikken.",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_subtitle": "Eller på skjermen, at kjøpet ikke blir godkjent. Da må du gå uten det du ville kjøpe.",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_1_title": "Det har skjedd meg!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_2_title": "Godt å vite!",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_3_title": "Litt flaut å ikke kunne betale",
  "school_story_17_screen_6_button_4_title": "Jeg vet dette",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_title": "Hva synes du virker smart å gjøre for å unngå å få feilmelding og bli tvunget til å returnere det du har tenkt å kjøpe?",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_1_title": "Ring en forelder",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_2_title": "Sjekk saldoen før",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_3_title": "Betal kun med kontanter",
  "school_story_17_screen_7_button_4_title": "Ingen av alternativene",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_title": "Det beste svaret er å holde styr på balansen. Et tips er å gå inn i bankappen din eller den digitale sparegrisen ofte for å sjekke det ut.",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_subtitle": "Handler du mye, så kanskje i hvert fall hver morgen og kveld. På denne måten kan du enkelt forstå hvor pengene dine går og hvor mye du kan handle for.",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_button_1_title": "Smart tips!",
  "school_story_17_screen_8_button_2_title": "Jeg skal tenke på det!",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_title": "Jeg snakket om det samme da vi gikk gjennom den aller første planeten. Jeg nevnte budsjett litt fort, da?",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_subtitle": "Jeg sa i alle fall allerede da at det er viktig å holde styr på pengene man får inn og hva man bruker. Da slipper du å kvitte deg med mer enn du har!",
  "school_story_17_screen_9_button_1_title": "Og du vil nok si det mer enn én gang",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_title": "Tro meg! Jeg skal mase om det.",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_subtitle": "Nå har du lært hvordan to kort du kan betale med fungerer. Forhåndsbetalte kort og bankkort.",
  "school_story_17_screen_11_button_1_title": "Det er riktig",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_title": "Nå går vi over til to andre typer kort du kan betale med.",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_subtitle": "Og disse to kortene er i den andre kategorien: kort der du ikke trenger å ha pengene når du betaler med kortet.",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_button_1_title": "Det virker veldig rart",
  "school_story_17_screen_12_button_2_title": "Kan du bare handle i vei, da?",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_title": "Det første i kategorien vi skal snakke om er Kredittkort.",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_subtitle": "Vet du hva det er?",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_1_title": "Selvfølgelig!",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_2_title": "Vet ikke",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_3_title": "Åh...nei",
  "school_story_17_screen_13_button_4_title": "Jeg vet litt",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_title": "De fleste kredittkort er også knyttet til bankkontoen din, akkurat som bankkortet. Men kjøper du noe med kredittkort, trenger du ikke ha alle pengene som trengs på kontoen.",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_subtitle": "Du handler da “på kreditt“. Det betyr at når du handler for mer penger enn du har på konto, låner du de ekstra pengene i banken.",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_button_1_title": "Jeg vet",
  "school_story_17_screen_14_button_2_title": "Nytt for meg",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_title": "Så skylder du banken penger senere. Vi snakket litt løst om det allerede på planeten om pengebruk.",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_subtitle": "Du har vanligvis en måned på deg til å betale tilbake pengene uten at noe skjer. Hvis du ikke betaler tilbake innen den tid, tar banken en rente.",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_button_1_title": "Var ikke rente noe du fikk?",
  "school_story_17_screen_15_button_2_title": "Akkurat det, renter kan tjenes eller betales!",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_title": "I dette tilfellet er renter det du betaler for å få låne pengene fra banken. For det er en tjeneste du kjøper. Da må du betale tilbake både gjelden og ekstra penger i renter.",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_subtitle": "Vi viser et eksempel!",
  "school_story_17_screen_16_button_1_title": "Et eksempel er nok bra!",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_title": "Du kjøper en jakke for 600kr, men har bare 200kr på kontoen. Du betaler med kredittkort, som betyr at du låner 400kr i banken og kan kjøpe jakken.",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_subtitle": "Du har ikke råd til å tilbakebetale dine lånte penger til banken i tide, noe som betyr at banken tar en rente på 10%. Hvor mye skylder du banken totalt nå?",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_1_title": "440kr",
  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_2_title": "460kr",

  "school_story_17_screen_17_button_4_title": "420kr",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_title": "Svaret er 440kr.",
  "school_story_17_screen_18_subtitle": "Gjelden er 400kr + renten er 400kr * 0,1 = 40kr. På denne måten har du betalt 640kr for jakken i stedet for 600kr.",

  "school_story_17_screen_18_button_2_title": "Forsto det",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_title": "Det siste kortet jeg vil fortelle deg om er debetkort. Handler du med debetkort låner du alle pengene du handler for.",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_subtitle": "Alt du kjøper samles da på en faktura, altså en regning, som du får en gang i måneden. Som med kredittkortet, skjer ingenting hvis du betaler i tide...",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_button_1_title": "Kult kort!",
  "school_story_17_screen_19_button_2_title": "Skremmende å låne alle pengene!",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_title": "... men hvis du ikke gjør betaler tilbake, blir det fort veldig dyrt!",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_subtitle": "Det var alle kortene! I den neste historien vil du lære om fakturaer.",
  "school_story_17_screen_20_button_1_title": "Ok!",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_title": "Som du har lagt merke til nå, er det mange ord å holde styr på når det kommer til privatøkonomi.",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_subtitle": "Noen ganger kan et ord bety forskjellige ting. Som renter. Det kan både være renter du tjener ved sparing, men også renter du må betale for å låne penger i banken.",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_button_1_title": "Av og til er det rotete",
  "school_story_18_screen_1_button_2_title": "Jeg har fortsatt god kontroll",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_title": "Og noen ord betyr det samme. For eksempel faktura og regning.",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_subtitle": "Og det er akkurat det vi skal snakke om nå, men jeg bruker bare ordet faktura.",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_button_1_title": "Det visste jeg!",
  "school_story_18_screen_2_button_2_title": "Regning og faktura er derfor det samme!",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_title": "En faktura er egentlig et slags gjeldsbrev eller en kontrakt som sier at du skylder penger.",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_subtitle": "Fakturaer sendes både til din postkasse og på mange forskjellige måter digitalt. Det er viktig å vite hvor de ulike fakturaene du får havner slik at du ikke går glipp av dem.",
  "school_story_18_screen_3_button_1_title": "Det er mye å holde styr på",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_title": "Men hvor kommer fakturaene fra? Vel, det er en måte å betale på etterskudd, så ikke direkte på kjøpstidspunktet. Slik gjør du: Du kjøper noe, betaler ikke akkurat da, og får deretter en faktura og en viss tid til å betale det.",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_subtitle": "Det er en veldig praktisk måte å betale for ting du bruker hele tiden. Som strøm! Tenk om du måtte betale direkte hver gang du slår på et lys eller lader telefonen.",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_button_1_title": "Det hadde vært urimelig!",
  "school_story_18_screen_4_button_2_title": "Det ville vært vanskelig",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_title": "Men du kan få fakturaer på mange ting, både for produkter, tjenester og slike ting som telefonregninger, strøm som jeg nevnte eller for debetkort vi snakket om på forrige stopp.",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_button_1_title": "Så for alt, da? Haha",
  "school_story_18_screen_5_button_2_title": "Oi, det trodde jeg ikke",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_title": "Hvor lang tid du får på å betale fakturaen er forskjellig, det bestemmer selskapet du kjøpte av. Det kan være alt fra noen dager til noen måneder.",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_subtitle": "Men et tips er at du alltid sjekker hvor mye tid du har på deg når du kjøper noe på en faktura, slik at du har råd til å betale det før tiden går ut.",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_button_1_title": "Smart!",
  "school_story_18_screen_6_button_2_title": "Virker unødvendig",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_title": "Datoen når pengene senest skal være innbetalt kalles forfallsdato.",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_subtitle": "Det står alltid på fakturaen. Det er viktig å huske på at forfallsdato IKKE er den dagen du skal betale, men den dagen selskapet skulle ha mottatt pengene.",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_button_1_title": "Forfallsdato - komplisert ord",
  "school_story_18_screen_7_button_2_title": "Det må jeg være forsiktig med",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_title": "Så du må sørge for å betale pengene i tide, noen ganger kan det ta noen dager før pengene kommer.",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_subtitle": "Vel, det var vel alt som var å vite om fakturaer.",
  "school_story_18_screen_8_button_1_title": "Nei, hei! Hvordan betaler jeg dem for eksempel?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_title": "Ville bare sjekke om du var med! Det er selvfølgelig mer å vite. Så vi fortsetter.",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_subtitle": "Betaling, sa du. Vel, du betaler dem ved hjelp av banken din. Det du gjør er at du overfører penger fra din egen konto til selskapets konto.",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_1_title": "Oj, så vanskelig!",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_2_title": "Tar det lang tid?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_3_title": "Må jeg gå til banken?",
  "school_story_18_screen_9_button_4_title": "Forklar mer",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_title": "Det virker nok mer komplisert enn det er. Du gjør alt digitalt på nettet. Men det er noen forskjellige måter å gjøre det på.",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_subtitle": "Man må holde styr på alle, for det er selskapene som bestemmer hvilke måter som er mulig.",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_button_1_title": "Ja, greit",
  "school_story_18_screen_11_button_2_title": "Hvorfor må de bestemme alt?",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_title": "Vi går gjennom de vanligste.",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_subtitle": "Får du fakturaen med brev hjem må du betale via nettbanken din. Da må du holde styr på litt annen informasjo fordi du må fylle ut alt for hånd.",
  "school_story_18_screen_12_button_1_title": "Hva slags informasjon?",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_title": "Enkelt sagt må du fylle ut: hvor mye du skal betale og hvem du skal betale til. All denne informasjonen står på fakturaen.",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_subtitle": "Den enkleste oppgaven er hvor mye du skal betale. Det kalles beløp.",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_button_1_title": "Jeg kjenner igjen det",
  "school_story_18_screen_13_button_2_title": "Ok, ganske enkelt",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_title": "Hvem det skal betales til er også enkelt, fordi det er selskapets bankkonto. Slike kontoer kalles bankgiro og er et tall du fyller inn.",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_subtitle": "Hvordan vet du nummeret da?",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_1_title": "Ringer en venn",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_2_title": "Spør banken",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_3_title": "Står på fakturaen",
  "school_story_18_screen_14_button_4_title": "Du finner på et selv!",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_title": "Siden disse fakturaene håndteres automatisk av selskaper, kan du ikke bare skrive navnet ditt for å fortelle dem hvem betalingen er fra.",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_subtitle": "Skriv i stedet inn et KID-nummer. Det er et langt tall som egentlig ikke betyr noe annet enn at det er du som har betalt fakturaen din.",
  "school_story_18_screen_15_button_1_title": "Jeg vil gjette! Nummeret står på fakturaen!",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_title": "Akkurat! Noen ganger er det ikke noe KID-nummer, men da står det som regel hva du skal skrive i stedet, slik at de vet hvem betalingen er fra.",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_subtitle": "Ofte får du fakturaene dine digitalt. Da er nesten alltid disse oppgavene allerede fylt ut. Da trenger du bare å godkjenne betalingen og signere.",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_button_1_title": "Ja, det virker enkelt",
  "school_story_18_screen_16_button_2_title": "Hvorfor er ikke alle sånn?",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_title": "Den siste måten jeg tenkte å nevne denne gangen er en måte som er veldig fleksibel, men den passer ikke alle, og du kan ikke velge den med alle selskaper.",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_subtitle": "Det kalles Avtalegiro. Da kan du godta at pengene automatisk trekkes fra kontoen din hver måned. Det passer bra om det er noe du betaler for hver måned, så du slipper å gjøre så mye.",
  "school_story_18_screen_17_button_1_title": "Et fakturabetalingsabonnement!",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_title": "God forklaring, det kunne du ha kalt det. Nå vet du at det er mange forskjellige måter å betale på, og for å bruke smart må du passe på å ikke velge en måte som gjør at du betaler mer i det lange løp.",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_subtitle": "Hva synes du ser ut til å være den beste måten å bruke på?",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_1_title": "Med kredittkort",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_2_title": "Spare til du har råd",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_3_title": "Låne penger når du ikke har",
  "school_story_18_screen_18_button_4_title": "Stjele dem i stedet!",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_title": "Hmm... Interessant...",
  "school_story_18_screen_19_subtitle": "Og hva tror du jeg synes er den beste måten å bruke på?",

  "school_story_18_screen_20_title": "Selvfølgelig synes jeg du skal spare til du har råd i stedet for å kjøpe på kreditt, jeg er en sparegris.",
  "school_story_18_screen_20_subtitle": "Det er lett å få mye gjeld, og så er det vanskelig å gjøre opp for det senere. Når det kommer til penger er det en naturlig å bruke noe, men du bør ikke bruke opp alt så det tar slutt!",
  "school_story_18_screen_20_button_1_title": "Word, Piggy",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_title": "Hva skjer egentlig hvis du ikke betaler det du skylder? Det er helt klart litt annerledes HVORDAN du gjør det!",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_subtitle": "For hvis du er i en butikk og løper derfra med varene uten å betale, er det butikktyveri.",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_button_1_title": "...og så kommer politiet",
  "school_story_19_screen_1_button_2_title": "Å stjele er feil",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_title": "Ja! Og har du fått et produkt eller en tjeneste og du har lovet å betale, så har du inngått en avtale. Og da blir du betalingspliktig.",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_subtitle": "Så hvis du ikke betaler når du skal, får det også konsekvenser. Selv om det ikke er det samme som å stjele i en butikk, kommer du ikke unna.",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_1_title": "Men jeg løper fort! Tuller!",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_2_title": "Jeg liker ikke konsekvenser",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_3_title": "Ja, det er åpenbart!",
  "school_story_19_screen_2_button_4_title": "Du må holde løftet ditt",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_title": "Du vet allerede om forskjellige måter å betale på, hvis du har vært på planet 6. Men alt er egentlig det samme:",
  "school_story_19_screen_3_subtitle": "en måte å betale for det du vil kjøpe. Husker du noen av måtene?",

  "school_story_19_screen_3_button_4_title": "Nei...",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_title": "Ofte kan du til og med velge hvordan du vil betale. Som da jeg kjøpte en figur av meg selv i glass på nett forrige uke.",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_subtitle": "Da kunne jeg velge mellom å betale direkte, med kort eller Vipps for eksempel, eller betale senere.",
  "school_story_19_screen_4_button_1_title": "Riktig!",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_title": "Velger du da å betale senere vil du motta en faktura, eller regning som det også kalles. Fakturaen inneholder all informasjon du trenger, spesielt datoen når den senest skal betales.",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_subtitle": "Hvis du ikke gjør det, vil du skylde penger. Skylder du penger kalles det å ha gjeld.",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_1_title": "Jeg visste det",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_2_title": "Jeg har ingen gjeld",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_3_title": "Jeg har en gjeld",
  "school_story_19_screen_5_button_4_title": "Har aldri hørt om en faktura",

  "school_story_19_screen_8_title": "I denne butikken har du 30 dager på deg til å betale fakturaen. Men det kan som kjent variere avhengig av hvilket selskap du handler hos.",

  "school_story_19_screen_11_button_4_title": "Kan de gjøre det?",
  "school_story_19_screen_12_title": "Ja, sånn er det. Fordi du faktisk var betalingspliktig. Påminnelsesgebyrer er vanligvis rundt 60 NOK.",
