  "school_story_6.2_screen_16_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_1_title": "Hope it went easily in the challenge. You get better at deciding which category a thing you want to buy belongs to the more you do it.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "What decisions?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_7_title": "Well, the decisions can be, for example, which model you want of something, which store to shop in or when to buy it.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wow, how many decisions you really make!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_title": "It can seem like a lot, but by comparing different alternatives it usually works.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_subtitle": "There are strategies for that too, that can help.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "What strategies?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "What is a strategy?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_title": "A strategy you can use, if you for example want to choose between different models of a phone is to make a list of pros and cons.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_subtitle": "Then you decide what you want and need in a phone, then you write down what the different models have or not.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "Doesn't sound that hard",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "I'll try it sometime",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_11_title": "When you don’t think through a purchase properly before, or make these decisions, you can do what is called impulse purchase.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_11_subtitle": "It is when you buy something as soon as you realize you want it, or for example as soon as you see it in the store.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "I decide for myself!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "Do we?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_14_title": "It could be that we are influenced by peer pressure, by what a sibling thinks or even by advertising.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_15_title": "It does not have to be a bad buy, but if you do not choose and think through what you yourself think, then the chances are greater that you are not satisfied.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_15_button_1_title": "Yes indeed",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_15_button_2_title": "No ..? Is it?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_16_title": "Of course you can ask for advice and what others think, but then decide for yourself if you agree!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_16_subtitle": "If you think before you shop, your purchases will simply be much better!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_16_button_1_title": "I'm starting to understand it",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Yeah",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_6_button_2_title": "Why?",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_title": "Say for example if someone takes out a loan and buys a car, then the money will end up with the car company, which in turn can afford to give wages to those who work there and then the employees will then be able to afford to buy things for their salary and so on.",
