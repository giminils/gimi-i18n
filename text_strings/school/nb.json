  "school_story_6_screen_text4": "PLZ_TRANSLATE I will start by asking you: Do you think it is good to buy something expensive?",
  "school_story_6_screen_text5": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Difficult question! Because something can be expensive because it costs a lot of money, or just more expensive than it usually is.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text6": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you can afford something that costs a lot, but it is more expensive than it <italics>usually</italics> is, it's smarter to wait for a better price.",

  "school_story_6_screen_text8": "PLZ_TRANSLATE The easiest answer is that you do it through knowing the price the things you buy often. Then you know what they usually cost and can compare.",

  "school_story_6_screen_text19": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes, well, the pizza is worth more, because the raw materials are more expensive and it takes more time and effort to make it.",
  "school_story_6_screen_text20": "PLZ_TRANSLATE And the ice cream should be cheaper for the same reason, and the ice cream is also a smaller portion of food than the ice cream or pizza.",

  "school_story_6_screen_text25": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Then, you can also compare prices of the same product in different stores. So you could check in the food stands close what a portion of french fries costs.",

  "school_story_15_screen_15_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Interest rate if you remember, is a percentage from the banks in savings accounts, and bonus works the same way. Let's say you have 100pb in your piggybank.",

  "school_story_15_screen_16_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yup! My second tip is something called ‘matched saving’. It's really simple, it's saving some yourself and getting the same amount for it.",
  "school_story_15_screen_16_subtitle": "PLZ_TRANSLATE If you ask your parents, or another family member and see if they would like to negotiate a deal to encourage you and help you to save. Maybe if you save up 100, they will give you 100?   ",

  "school_story_15_screen_17_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE I don't know, it depends on your family, remember to ask and negotiate in a nice professional manner, don't demand! They don't owe you or have to agree.",
  "school_story_15_screen_17_subtitle": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Okay, so another hack is to set saving goals. Actually, I have seen that kids that use the goal map in the app and set savings goals are generally better at saving!",

  "school_story_15_screen_19_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yup, I have one last one, and this one you can do all by yourself! It's called the ‘the round-up method.’",

  "school_story_15_screen_19_button_4_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE ...by rounding up?",
  "school_story_15_screen_20_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE It's also simple, and a way to trick yourself to save often but just a little. But you know what they say: ‘from acorns grow oak trees,’ every little helps!",

  "school_story_15_screen_20_button_2_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Can you please give an example?",

  "school_story_15_screen_21_subtitle": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Or you buy a hat, you pay 349pb, you round up to 350, the difference is 1pb, so you put that in savings.",

  "school_story_15_screen_22_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Yes it's a little every time, but that makes it easy and you don't notice it much. And you do it many times! So it collects! It becomes a way to trick yourself to save! And everything you save is great!",

  "school_story_16_screen_3_button_2_title": "PLZ_TRANSLATE Jag gillar att använda hjärnan",
