  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_title": "I know that this might be very simple for you, but I wanted to explain it, just in case.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_subtitle": "Also to make you understand that when handling money you use math to count everything.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_button_1_title": "Ok. I’ll do the challenge now.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_title": "Let's talk some more about saving. I explained the math words previously, because you need those things here.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "How?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_title": "You should never spend more than you have, right?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Right!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_title": "This is where addition and subtraction comes in.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_subtitle": "I will use them to explain why you should not spend more money than you have.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Mmm... ok?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_title": "If you have 5 apples, you only have those 5 apples. Not more and not less.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can’t eat more than 5 apples, because you don't have more.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_2_title": "No, you can’t!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_title": "But, when you are an adult, if you have a card you pay with, you can sometimes spend more than you have in your bank account. Then you get a negative balance in your account.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_subtitle": "That’s a bad thing.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "Why is that bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_title": "It is bad because when you spend more than you have, you actually borrow money from the bank,or somebody else.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_subtitle": "And loans cost money. You have to pay for them, like you would any other product or service.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_button_1_title": "Show me with math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_title": "Okay! So, you have 5 pb. If you spend 7 pb on a candy bar, that means you had to borrow 2 pb from the bank.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_subtitle": "5 - 7 = -2",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "This is such easy math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_title": "Then you don’t have any money left <italic>and</italic> you owe the bank 2 pb. You might also have to pay interest.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_subtitle": "If you keep spending that way, sooner or later you will end up in debt.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Debt?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Sounds bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_title": "By saving, you are adding instead of subtracting.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Of course spending is necessary sometimes, and something you have to do. But you should spend in a smart way.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "Sounds logical",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_2_title": "I want to know more!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_title": "One way of doing it, is to save up before the purchase.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Let's say you have the same 5 pb from the previous example. You save 3 pb every week for three weeks.\n5 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_title": "Now you have 14 pb. If you want to buy that candy bar we talked about for 7 pb, you have 7 pb left after the purchase!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_subtitle": "You could buy the candy and have some money left over. Just because you waited with spending until you had saved up.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Saving seems nice!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "That does sound better",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_3_title": "I’m still confused",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_4_title": "But I don't like saving",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_title": "That is why saving is important. Spending more than you have can become expensive, and cause a lot of problems.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_subtitle": "Always making sure to have some money saved up, is a real Financial Superskill!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_1_title": "I will try!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_2_title": "Okay, I want Superskills",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_title": "Yup, so to summarise this destination's take-away message:",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_subtitle": "Saving is just putting away money. It means to let the money you have, grow over time. And to earn and save more money than you spend.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_title": "Hey, good job on the challenge! I was actually just sitting and sorting the coins in my savings.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_subtitle": "I have done some recycling and helping out around my neighbourhood, so I earned some money!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "I do that sometimes too",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_2_title": "I haven't earned any money yet...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_title": "Okay, well as you learned on the planet about earning, it's great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_subtitle": "I love saving the money I earn, cause I can see it grow, almost like a plant!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_button_1_title": "It's good when money grows!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_title": "I have a savings goal now and can see how I get closer to reaching it, it feels great.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_subtitle": "I am trying to decide if I should save the money I earned..",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "What is the alternative?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "Buy gaming currency!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_title": "I have had my eye on a space scooter for a while now. It's like a regular scooter but with it’s own atmosphere.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_subtitle": "That means you don't have to wear a space suit while riding it! And it makes the coolest ”bluphbluph”-sound!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Sounds cool!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_title": "We can talk more about the scooter later, but first we will continue talking about saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "Great, let’s go!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "I want a space scooter too!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_title": "I previously explained that saving is important, so that you don't have to spend more than you have, because it is more expensive in the long run.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_subtitle": "But it’s also important because you get more money when you save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Get more money? I don’t get it",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Well yeah, if you save, you have money. Right?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_title": "Well actually, you get <bold>more</bold> money when you save! If you save your money in the bank, in a savings account, you earn interest. You can get more money by saving!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_subtitle": "Interest is a sum of money that the bank pays you when you let them keep your money for a while.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wait, the bank pays <bold>me</bold>?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_title": "Sure thing! The bank pays you money if you promise you will leave the money in your account for a while. You lock it in the account for a while",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_subtitle": "This means that the longer you keep the money in the account, the more you save there, the more money you get paid!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Sounds great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "That seems risky?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_title": "It’s not very risky, because for savings accounts, there is a guarantee that you will get the money back if something happens to the bank.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_subtitle": "There are other ways to save where there is a risk of losing some , but where you also have the chance to earn more money.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "I want to earn more, tell me how!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_title": "Let's wait a bit with those other ways, because there's some more information you need to know before you are ready.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_subtitle": "There are many different ways to save, but generally they can be divided into long-term saving and short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay, long-term and short-term",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_2_title": "🤑",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_3_title": "What is long-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_4_title": "What is short-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_title": "Let's start with short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_subtitle": "The simplest way of short-term saving is just to put away your money, and try not to spend it.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Sounds too simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_2_title": "But that's kinda hard",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_title": "It can be pretty hard! But in that way you make sure that you have money for the things you really need or want.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Money disappears quickly when you buy a soda here, an ice cream there...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Yeah. I noticed!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "I know, that's why I save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_title": "Long-term saving as you might suspect, just means that you save for a long time.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_button_1_title": "Yup, simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_title": "How long you save, for when you are saving long-term, varies. But usually it’s for several years.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_subtitle": "A lot of people, for example, save for their retirement. That is when you get older and stop working. That means you save almost your entire life for that!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_1_title": "Wow, that's so long!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_2_title": "I have saved for years already",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_title": "The best way to do it, is to save both short-term and long-term.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_subtitle": "You could actually start saving long term already. Start saving for a driver's license or furniture that you will need when you move out of your parents house.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_button_1_title": "But wait, that's a very long time!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_title": "Yes, it might feel that way. But you only have to save a little every month. Because you save over a longer period of time, in the end, it will be quite a lot of money anyway!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_subtitle": "Let's say you are 10 years old. If you just save 50 pb a month, you would have 6000 pb in total when you turn 18. The bank would give 1000 pb just for saving in their bank. ",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_1_title": "Is that enough?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_2_title": "I save long term!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_3_title": "That much?!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_4_title": "Maybe I should start...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_title": "Anyway, I have decided! I will save up money to buy that space scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_subtitle": "I would love some chocolate, but I won't buy any. I will save the money for that space scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_1_title": "Sounds smart",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_2_title": "Sounds hard",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_1_title": "Oh, you're here! Come and have a look!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_1_subtitle": "I'm sitting here doing something...",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_1_button_1_title": "What's that Piggy?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_2_title": "I'm watching my transactions for this month!",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_2_button_1_title": "Tran ... sac..t?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_title": "Transactions! When you check them, you can see the money you have spent and what you spent it on!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_subtitle": "You can also see money that is added to the account. Such as your allowance or gifts. It’s a list of your money going in and out.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_button_1_title": "Can I also see mine?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Why do you want to watch it?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_title": "Everyone who has a bank account or the piggybank in Gimi can do it!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_subtitle": "And I'm looking at my transactions to see what I bought this month. It’s good to keep track of!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "But, don’t you remember what you bought?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_title": "If I didn’t buy that many things, I remember. But when I buy a lot of small things like sweets or drinks, it’s easy to quickly forget all purchases!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_subtitle": "If you check your transactions from time to time, you can see how much you have spent on different things.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Still don’t understand why you want to?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_2_title": "I usually check!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_title": "It's good to check the transactions. If you save for something expensive and nice, for example, you do not want to spend too much.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_subtitle": "In your transactions, you may see that you have spent almost the entire weekly allowance on sweets. Or Robux. And then it takes longer before you can buy your expensive thing.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_1_title": "Yeah, okay",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_2_title": "But the money is already gone then!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_title": "If you keep track of what you spend, even if you look some time back, you can understand where the money went.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_subtitle": "And the next time you get your allowance, it's easier to save more, because you're thinking about it! Smart, huh?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yeah that sounds smart",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_2_title": "Nothing new to me",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_title": "This was my first tip on what to think about when spending. Or rather, when you’ve already spent your money!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_subtitle": "There are also some other things that are important to start thinking about early on, when you start managing your own money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "What Piggy? Where the nearest store is?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_title": "Well, it can of course be very tempting to splurge as soon as you get money, but on the planet about saving, you learned how important it is to save.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_subtitle": "But you have to be allowed to shop too! If you spend in a smart way, you can save a lot of money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Yes, shopping is nice!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_button_2_title": "Ugh, I like saving more",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_11_title": "When you are good at earning, saving and spending money, then you have good and stable personal finances. People who have balanced and stable finances are happier and feel much better than people who don’t. ",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_title": "You are back quickly! Hope it went well.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_subtitle": "Now let's talk a little bit about how to think when you want to buy things, or simply use your money.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Okay, go",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_title": "The big problem with money is that very few people and pigs have large amounts of it.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_subtitle": "You only have a certain amount of money you get or earn, and if you don’t save, it runs out. This is not only true while being a kid, but also when you grow up.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_title": "It can seem like a lot, but by comparing different alternatives it usually works.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_title": "A strategy you can use, if you for example want to choose between different models of a phone, is to make a list of pros and cons.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_subtitle": "That means you decide what you want and need in a phone, then you write down what the different models have or not.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_4_subtitle": "Back in the days when we mostly used coins and banknotes, the bank was a good storage space for money you wouldn’t need any time soon.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "A money-hotel!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_title": "Cause even though banknotes are lighter than coins, there’s a limit to how many you can fit in a pocket.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_subtitle": "Instead you placed money in the bank, who’d store it for you until you wanted to withdraw it.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "As in withdrawing from an ATM.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_7_title": "The bank is happy to store your money because that actually means that it is borrowing money from <italic>you</italic>!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_7_subtitle": "This is why the banks often pay you to store your money with them.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_7_button_1_title": "This is called interest!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_title": "Exactly! Interest! You’ve done the bank a favour and so you gain interest.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_subtitle": "The banks get a whole lot of money since there’s a lot of people who store their money with them.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "I’m gonna start a bank",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "It’s always interest!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_13_title": "Yes, the word interest can be used for a lot of things! It’s both something you can get <italic>from</italic> the bank and something you pay <italic>to</italic> the bank.",

  "school_story_7.2_screen_6_button_1_title": "A loan is a service, exactly",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_6_button_2_title": "And you buy the farm with the loan",

  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "I know this a little bit",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Ok, all of something is 100%",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_10_title": "If the cake is cut up in 10 pieces, that makes one piece 10%. 100% divided in 10 = 10%",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_10_subtitle": "If you then take 5 pieces that would be 50%.",

  "school_story_7.2_screen_13_button_4_title": "Cool, moving to the moon",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_14_title": "So a loan can be something good, since you actually need one to buy the expensive things you really need.",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_14_subtitle": "But you shouldn’t borrow money for things you don’t need. That’s just a waste. And of course you need to make sure you can afford the interest!",

  "school_story_7.3_screen_2_title": "The banks pay out an interest once a year based on what you have saved in your savings account. It’s calculated the same way as the loan interest.",

  "school_story_7.3_screen_2_button_2_title": "With maths…?",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_title": "Let’s say you have 1000 pb saved on your saving account which gives 1% in interest…",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_subtitle": "… that will give you 10 pb in interest at the end of the year. Since 1% of 1000 is 10.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "That’s almost nothing!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "How cheap!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_button_3_title": "Better than nothing",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_3_button_4_title": "I want more",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_4_title": "It can seem like a little, but the bank almost always has a low savings interest.",

  "school_story_7.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Do tell!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_4_button_2_title": "Awesome!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_5_title": "If you promise the bank that you won’t withdraw money at all for a period of time, then the bank can give you a higher savings interest.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_5_subtitle": "This is good for the bank, because then they can use the money you promised not to withdraw.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "So you lock the money?",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_6_title": "Let’s say you promise not to touch the money for 3 years, then the bank might give you 3% interest.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_6_subtitle": "Then you’d make 30 pb instead of 10 pb, on the 1000 pb in your savings account.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Three times as much!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "I still want more",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_8_title": "The trick is that you can’t use the money at all during the time it’s locked. So you need to plan well.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_8_subtitle": "But with some clever thinking, you can earn a lot!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_8_button_1_title": "Seems hard not being able to use the money!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_8_button_2_title": "Makes sense to do that",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_9_title": "A bank usually offers different kinds of accounts. The savings account usually gives interest, but it’s common to have other accounts too.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_9_subtitle": "For instance a transaction account, in which you receive your salary. You can also use that account to transfer money to others.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "I’ve got my own account!",

  "school_story_7.3_screen_9_button_4_title": "I save all my money!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_10_title": "The transaction account is sometimes called a salary account. Usually you don’t get any interest there.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_10_subtitle": "You can connect a bank card to the transaction account. That way you can buy things with the card and the bank automatically makes the transfer from your account.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "Smooth!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_11_title": "But you should keep your money in the savings account, if you want to get interest.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_11_subtitle": "And since the bank card usually is connected to the transaction account it is safer to have most of the money on the savings account.",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "I see, in case the card gets stolen!",
  "school_story_7.3_screen_12_title": "Exactly! And you? Did you know that you can get interest on the money in the Gimi app too? It’s called bonus!",

  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_button_4_title": "Good question!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_title": "Well, all these new ways of paying are actually based on the “classic” ways of paying. ",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_subtitle": "And I’ll explain more about how that works later, but let me first go through the “classic” ways, as I call them.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay, that’s fair",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_title": "When I talk about the classic ways of paying, I mean paying with cash or some type of card.",

  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_button_4_title": "I become poor",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_13_title": "The answer is actually a bit different depending on what type of card you are using. See! It's already more complicated that you'd think!",

  "school_story_9.2_screen_1_title": "I hope you’re ready, because now we'll talk about the three most common types of cards.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Let’s go!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_title": "Let's talk about the bank card first. It is the most used card in most countries in the world.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_subtitle": "It’s also the card that you may already be using, or will get soon. unlike credit cards, you can get a bank card when you are younger than 18 years old.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Oh no, the credit card seemed cool",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "I have a bank card",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_3_title": "Don’t have one yet",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_4_title": "I have some type of card",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_title": "A bank card, as you can tell from the name, is a card you’re given by your bank.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_subtitle": "To get a bank card you must have a special account with that bank. The card is connected to that account..",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Yes!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_title": "Since the bank card is connected to the account, the money is withdrawn from that account when you use it the store or online.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_subtitle": "But of course, someone needs to put the money into the account first, otherwise the balance will be 0!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "My parents!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_title": "When you use the card in a card reader in a store, the reader checks the balance on your bank account first..",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_subtitle": "If there’s enough money the purchase is accepted and the money is removed from the account.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "I knew this",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_button_2_title": "This was new!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_title": "If there isn’t enough money on the account the card reader will give the message “error”…",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_subtitle": "It’ll say that the transaction is denied. You won’t be able to buy the thing you wanted to get.",

  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_button_4_title": "I know this",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_title": "What do you think seems smart to do to avoid getting an error message and not being able to get the thing you wanted to buy?",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Call a parent",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "Check the balance before",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_3_title": "Only pay with cash",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_4_title": "None of the options",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_title": "The best answer is to keep track of the balance. A tip is to go into your bank app or your digital piggy bank often to check it.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_subtitle": "If you shop a lot, then maybe at least every evening. In that way you can easily understand where your money is going and how much you have left to spend.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Smart tip!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_title": "I’ve said it many times before: you should know your balance. Knowing that, is in many ways important, also to keep track of the money you earn and the money you spend. ",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_subtitle": "That way you’ll avoid spending more than you have, and have more control over your finances.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "And you will probably say it again",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_title": "Yeah! I will keep talking about that, haha.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Alright, so you’ve learned how the bank card works. Let’s talk about the prepaid card now. It works almost the same way as the bank card. ",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_button_1_title": "I may have heard of it",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_title": "The prepaid cardworks the same way when you pay, but there’s no account connected to the card.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_subtitle": "All the money must be added to the card before you shop. You charge it, like a gift card.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Smooth!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "Okay I get it",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_title": "The big difference is that a gift card can only be used in the store where you bought it, while the prepaid card works almost everywhere.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_button_1_title": "I think I have one",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_button_2_title": "I’m still following!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_title": "The two cards we’ve just talked about, the prepaid card and the bank card, are very similar. You must have money before you buy something.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_subtitle": "The only difference is that with the prepaid card, the money is on the card. With the bank card, the money is in a bank account.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_button_1_title": "Okay!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_button_2_title": "Yup!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_title": "I hope it went well and that you got to rehearse what you learned!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_subtitle": "The last thing we talked about before the challenge was the prepaid card.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "That seems to be the case!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_title": "So that leaves the last card that I mentioned: The credit card.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_subtitle": "Do you know what it is?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_1_title": "Of course!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_2_title": "Don't know",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_3_title": "Uhm... nah",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_4_title": "I recognize it",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_title": "It’s different from the other two cards we talked about, because you don’t need money when you shop. ",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "That sounds really weird!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "So you can just go crazy?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_title": "When you shop with the credit card, no money is withdrawn anywhere. But all the things you buy are registered.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_subtitle": "At the end of the month you get an invoice, or a bill as it is also called. Then you pay for everything in one go.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "But where does the money come from?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_title": "Credit cards are what you can call a loan-card. If you buy something with a credit card, you borrow the money from the bank or a company.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_subtitle": "You then shop ’on credit’.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "I'm aware of that",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "News to me",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_title": "We loosely talked about it already on the planet about spending.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_subtitle": "You usually have one month to pay back the money without anything happening. If you do not pay back within that time, the bank or company that issued the credit card charges an interest rate.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Isn’t interest something you get?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Yes, but interest can be earned or paid!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_title": "Interest in this case, is the cost you pay for lending the money from the bank. As I mentioned before, getting a loan is a service that you pay for.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_1_title": " 💳",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_2_title": "👍",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_3_title": "🏦",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_4_title": "💰",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_title": "And if you shop for borrowed money, you must repay the debt <bold>and</bold> the extra interest.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_subtitle": "Let’s try an example!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Yeah, I’d like that",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_title": "You buy a jacket for 600 pb and you pay with a credit card. You cannot afford to pay the invoice on time, so you will have to pay interest..",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_subtitle": "The interest rate is 10%, which in this case means you pay 60 pb in interest. How much do you owe the bank in total?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "6600 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "460 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_3_title": "660 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_4_title": "420 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_title": "The correct answer is 660 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_subtitle": "It is the debt of 600 pb, + interest of 60 pb. In this way you have paid 660 pb for the jacket instead of 600 pb",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "Oh",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_button_2_title": "I understand",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_title": "Credit cards work well if you are very careful and always pay on time, and never buy more than you can afford to pay back.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_subtitle": "There we go, now you know some things about credit cards as well. Even if you can’t use one just yet.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Nice to know!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_button_2_title": "I want one now…",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_title": "You did well in the challenge!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_subtitle": "Now that you know how the cards work, I want to talk about other methods of paying that we mentioned in the beginning of this planet.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_button_1_title": "Likeapps and smartwatches?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_title": "Yes exactly! I saved them until now. Because even though they seem new and different, they are based on the classic ways of paying.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_subtitle": "When you pay with the Apple Wallet or a smartwatch, or any other app, you most often “tap” the phone or watch to the payment machine.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_button_1_title": "Yes!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_button_2_title": "You do?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_title": "But for this to work, you must first have a card, and that card needs to be connected to the app or the watch!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_subtitle": "So actually you’re still paying with your card. But you do it by “tapping” your phone or card..",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_button_1_title": "Oh right!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_title": "Yes, it is actually the card that you pay with. In some countries you can also connect your phone number to your card and pay via special apps.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_subtitle": "Usually you set this up with your bank. Then you can use an app to pay with your phone number. ",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_button_1_title": "Hold on, explain more.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_5_title": "The bank connects your account to your phone number. Once this is done, anyone can transfer money simply by using the phone number. ",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_5_button_1_title": "How?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_title": "So, both the phone number and the bank card are connected to a bank account. When you use any of these, money is removed from your account.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_subtitle": "This is done when you use your card or when you use an app to transfer money.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_button_1_title": "Is that really safe?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_title": "It’s quite safe. All these apps use a security system and you usually have to use a password or a code to pay. Just like with cards! ",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_subtitle": "But of course you have to make sure your password and code are safe, so no one else can use them.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_button_1_title": "Okay!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_button_2_title": "I think I get it now",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_title": "As you have noticed by now, there are many words to keep in mind when it comes to personal finances.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_subtitle": "Sometimes a word can mean different things. Like interest. It can be both interest you earn when saving, but also interest you have to pay for borrowing money from the bank.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_button_1_title": "Sometimes it's messy",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_button_2_title": "I think I’ve got a handle on it",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_title": "And some words mean the same thing. For example, invoice and bill.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_subtitle": "And that's exactly what we're going to talk about now, but I'll just use the word invoice.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_button_1_title": "I knew that!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_button_2_title": "Invoice and bill are the same thing!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_title": "An invoice is actually a kind of letter of debt or contract that you owe money.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_subtitle": "You can receive invoices both in the regular mailbox, and in many ways digitally. It is important to know where the different invoices you get end up so you are aware of them.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_button_1_title": "There is a lot to keep track of",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_title": "There sure is, isn’t there? But you can’t get invoices until you turn 18. Still, I want you to understand some things about them anyway.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_subtitle": "Where do invoices come from?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_button_1_title": "Good question",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_button_2_title": " I know!!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_title": "Well, they are a way of paying later, which means not paying at the time you actually make the purchase. Like this: ",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_subtitle": "You buy something, later on you get an invoice. You have to pay the invoice no later than the date written on the invoice. .",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_button_1_title": "⏰",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_button_2_title": "🧠",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_title": "It is a handy way of paying for things you use all the time. Like electricity! Imagine if you had to pay directly, every time you turn on a lamp or charge your phone.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_button_1_title": "That would be crazy!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_button_2_title": "That would be a hassle",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_title": "But you can get invoices for many different reasons. Like products, services or for credit cards, like we talked about.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_button_1_title": "So for like everything!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_button_2_title": "Wow, didn't know that",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_16_title": "Now you’ve learned a lot about different ways of paying. It would be possible to spend money without knowing all this…",
