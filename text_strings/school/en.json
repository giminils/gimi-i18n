  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "I get it!",

  "school_story_5.1_screen_11_button_2_title": "It's when you take away things",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_11_button_3_title": "It's when you divide",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_11_button_4_title": "It's when you eat the apples",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_12_title": "It's when you take away, or subtract things! If you have 5 apples and take away 2, you have 3 left. That's called subtraction in math.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "Yes, yes. I know all this!",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_12_button_2_title": "Thanks for the reminder!",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_title": "I know that this might be very simple for you, but I wanted to explain it, just in case.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_subtitle": "Also to make you understand that when handling money you use math to count everything.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_button_1_title": "Ok. I’ll do the challenge now.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_title": "Let's talk some more about saving. I explained the math words previously, because you need those things here.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "How?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_title": "You should never spend more than you have, right?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Right!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_title": "This is where addition and subtraction comes in.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_subtitle": "I will use them to explain why you should not spend more money than you have.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Mmm... ok?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_title": "If you have 5 apples, you only have those 5 apples. Not more and not less.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can’t eat more than 5 apples, because you don't have more.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_2_title": "No, you can’t!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_title": "But if you have a card you pay with, you can sometimes spend more than you have in your bank account. Then you get a negative balance in your account.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_subtitle": "That’s a bad thing.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "Why is that bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_title": "It is bad because when you spend more than you have, you actually borrow money from the bank,or somebody else.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_subtitle": "And loans cost money. You have to pay for them, like you would any other product or service.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_button_1_title": "Show me with math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_title": "Okay! So, you have 5pb. If you spend 7pb on a candy bar, that means you had to borrow 2pb from the bank.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_subtitle": "5 - 7 = -2",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "This is such easy math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_title": "Then you don’t have any money left <italic>and</italic> you owe the bank 2pb. You might also have to pay interest.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_subtitle": "If you keep spending that way, sooner or later you will end up in debt.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Debt?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Sounds bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_title": "By saving, you are adding instead of subtracting.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Of course spending is necessary sometimes, and something you have to do. But you should spend in a smart way.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "Sounds logical",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_2_title": "I want to know more!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_title": "One way of doing it, is to save up before the purchase.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Let's say you have the same 5pb from the previous example. You save 3pb every week for three weeks.\n5 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_title": "Now you have 14pb. If you want to buy that candy bar we talked about for 7pb, you have 7pb left after the purchase!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_subtitle": "You could buy the candy and have some money left over. Just because you waited with spending until you had saved up.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Saving seems nice!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "That does sound better",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_3_title": "I’m still confused",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_4_title": "But I don't like saving",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_title": "That is why saving is important. Spending more than you have can become expensive, and cause a lot of problems.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_subtitle": "Always making sure to have some money saved up, is a real Financial Superskill!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_1_title": "I will try!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_2_title": "Okay, I want Superskills",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_title": "Yup, so to summarise this destination's take-away message:",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_subtitle": "Saving is just putting away money. It means to let the money you have, grow over time. And to earn and save more money than you spend.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_title": "Hey, good job on the challenge! I was actually just sitting and sorting the coins in my savings.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_subtitle": "I have done some recycling and helping out around my neighbourhood, so I earned some money!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "I do that sometimes too",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_2_title": "I haven't earned any money yet...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_title": "Okay, well as you learned on the planet about earning, it's great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_subtitle": "I love saving the money I earn, cause I can see it grow, almost like a plant!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_button_1_title": "It's good when money grows!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_title": "I have a savings goal now and can see how I get closer to reaching it, it feels great.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_subtitle": "I am trying to decide if I should save the money I earned..",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "What is the alternative?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "Buy gaming currency!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_title": "I have had my eye on a space scooter for a while now. It's like a regular scooter but with its own atmosphere.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_subtitle": "That means you don't have to wear a space suit while riding it! And it makes the coolest ”bluphbluph”-sound!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Sounds cool!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_title": "We can talk more about the scooter later, but first we will continue talking about saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "Great, let’s go!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "I want a space scooter too!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_title": "I previously explained that saving is important, so that you don't have to spend more than you have, because it is more expensive in the long run.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_subtitle": "But it’s also important because you get more money when you save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Get more money? I don’t get it",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Well yeah, if you save, you have money. Right?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_title": "Well actually, you get <bold>more</bold> money when you save! If you save your money in the bank, in a savings account, you earn interest. You can get more money by saving!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_subtitle": "Interest is a sum of money that the bank pays you when you let them keep your money for a while.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wait, the bank pays <bold>me</bold>?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_title": "Sure thing! The bank pays you money if you promise you will leave the money in your account for a while. You lock them in the account for a while",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_subtitle": "This means that the longer you keep the money in the account, the more you save there, the more money you get paid!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Sounds great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "That seems risky?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_title": "It’s not very risky, because for savings accounts, there is a guarantee that you will get the money back if something happens to the bank.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_subtitle": "There are other ways to save where there is a risk of losing some , but where you also have the chance to earn more money.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "I want to earn more, tell me how!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_title": "Let's wait a bit with those other ways, because there's some more information you need to know before you are ready.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_subtitle": "There are many different ways to save, but generally they can be divided into long-term saving and short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay, long-term and short-term",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_2_title": "🤑",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_3_title": "What is long-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_4_title": "What is short-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_title": "Let's start with short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_subtitle": "The simplest way of short-term saving is just to put away your money, and try not to spend it.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Sounds too simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_2_title": "But that's kinda hard",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_title": "It can be pretty hard! But in that way you make sure that you have money for the things you really need or want.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Money disappears quickly when you buy a soda here, an ice cream there...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Yeah. I noticed!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "I know, that's why I save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_title": "Long-term saving as you might suspect, just means that you save for a long time.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_button_1_title": "Yup, simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_title": "How long you save, for when you are saving long-term, varies. But usually it’s for several years.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_subtitle": "A lot of people, for example, save for their retirement. That is when you get older and stop working. That means you save almost your entire life for that!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_1_title": "Wow, that's so long!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_2_title": "I have saved for years already",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_title": "The best way to do it, is to save both short-term and long-term.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_subtitle": "You could actually start saving long term already. Start saving for a driver's license or furniture that you will need when you move out of your parents house.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_button_1_title": "But wait, that's a very long time!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_title": "Yes, it might feel that way. But you only have to save a little every month. Because you save over a longer period of time, in the end, it will be quite a lot of money anyway!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_subtitle": "Let's say you are 10 years old. If you just save 50pb a month, you would have 6000pb in total when you turn 18. The bank would give 1000pb just for saving in their bank. ",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_1_title": "Is that enough?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_2_title": "I save long term!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_3_title": "That much?!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_4_title": "Maybe I should start...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_title": "Anyway, I have decided! I will save up money to buy that space scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_subtitle": "I would love some chocolate right now, but I won't buy any. I will save the money for that space scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_1_title": "Sounds smart",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_2_title": "Sounds hard",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_title": "Transactions! When you check those, you can see the money you have spent and what you spent it on!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_subtitle": "You can also see what money that have come in, such as your allowence or gifts. It’s a list of your money going in and out.",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_subtitle": "And I'm looking at my transactions to see what I bought this month. It's good to know!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "But, don’t you remember what you bought?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_title": "If I didn’t buy that much, I remember. But when I buy a lot of small things like sweets or drinks, it’s easy to quickly forget all purchases!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_subtitle": "If you check your transactions from time to time, you can see how much you have spent on different things.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Still don’t understand why you want to?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_2_title": "I usually watch!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_title": "Its good to do. If you save for something expensive and nice, for example, you do not want to spend too much.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_subtitle": "In your transactions, you may see that you have spent almost the entire weekly allowance on sweets. Or Robux. And then it takes longer before you can buy your expensive thing.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_1_title": "Yeah, okay",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_2_title": "But the money is already gone then!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_title": "If you keep track of what you spend, even if you look some time back, you can understand where the money went.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_subtitle": "And the next time you get allowance, it's easier to save more, because you're thinking about it! Smart, huh?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yeah that sounds smart",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_2_title": "Nothing new to me",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_title": "It was my first tip on what to think about when spending. Or when you have spent already!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_subtitle": "There are also some other things that are important to start thinking about early on, when you start managing your own money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "What Piggy? Where the nearest store is?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_title": "Well, it can of course be very tempting to throw money around as soon as you get it, but on the planet on saving you learned why it is important to save.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_subtitle": "But you have to be able to shop too! If you shop smart, you can save a lot of money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Yes, shopping too!",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_title": "You are back quickly! Hope it went well.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_subtitle": "Now let's talk a little bit about how to think when you want to buy things, or simply use your money.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Okay, go",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_title": "The big problem with money is that very few people and Piggy’s have large amounts of it.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_subtitle": "You only have a certain amount of money you get or earn, and if you don’t save, they run out. It's not just now it is like this it’s the same when you are an adult.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wow, how many decisions you really make!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_title": "It can seem like a lot, but by comparing different alternatives it usually works.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "What is a strategy?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_title": "A strategy you can use, if you for example want to choose between different models of a phone is to make a list of pros and cons.",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_10_subtitle": "Then you decide what you want and need in a phone, then you write down what the different models have or not.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "I decide for myself!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "Do we?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_14_title": "It could be that we are influenced by peer pressure, by what a sibling thinks or even by advertising.",

  "school_story_6.3_screen_15_button_2_title": "No ..? Is it?",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_16_title": "Of course you can ask for advice and what others think, but then decide for yourself if you agree!",
  "school_story_6.3_screen_16_subtitle": "If you think before you shop, your purchases will simply be much better!",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_1_button_2_title": "Well, pretty insecure ...",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_2_title": "It is with the bank that you have your money. So it is through the bank that payments are made, both when money is added or deducted.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_2_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_3_title": "What the bank works on the most is to protect and take care of money that customers save with them and lend money to people who are going to buy something expensive, maybe a house or a car.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Yeah",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_4_title": "When you borrow, you promise the bank that you will repay everything in the end. But if banks lend money and then get it back, how do they make money then?",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_4_button_4_title": "Through the lottery?",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_title": "Well, the borrower pays back some of the money every month plus interest, which is an extra cost the banks charge for offering this service and then the bank gets a profit.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Like I Said!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_5_button_2_title": "Yeah",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_6_title": "To see if someone is creditworthy, the bank checks if the person has a stable finances. Then they check what the customer has for income, expenses and if they have been able to pay bills and debts before.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_6_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_6_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_8_title": "This is so that people will not be able to borrow more than they can afford to pay later.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_8_subtitle": "This leads us on to the next big responsibility that banks have in society ...",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "It's good",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_8_button_2_title": "Wow, what could it be?",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_title": "Say for example if someone takes out a loan and buys a car, then the money will end up with the car company, which in turn can afford to give wages to those who work there and then the employees will then be able to afford to buy things for their salary and so on.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "I had bought a new mobile",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_button_2_title": "I see a pattern",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_10_title": "Do you now see how the economy in society is connected and can be affected by whether people have money or not?",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Sure!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_10_button_2_title": "Well ... not really",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_title": "If no one has the money to buy things, it will be the same thing but the opposite. Then shops may have to close instead or lay off staff because they can not afford it.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_subtitle": "Then it becomes a vicious circle because the unemployed can not afford to buy things either ...",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_button_1_title": "It does not sound good at all",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_button_2_title": "Very bad!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_button_3_title": "😱",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_button_4_title": "Then I understand",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_12_title": "It is a very big responsibility they have. Therefore, there are laws that make sure they do their job right because there can be big consequences otherwise.",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "Oops, sounds serious",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_12_button_2_title": "It's good!",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_13_title": "The bank not only makes money by lending money. They also make money by trading stocks for customers and giving advice on how to invest their money so they grow.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_13_button_2_title": "Stocks are difficult",
  "school_story_7.1_screen_14_title": "It can be good to get advice from the bank because those who work there are experts.",

  "school_story_7.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Okay",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_title": "It is good not to have too much money in your transaction account. So when you get a salary or another large sum, you usually transfer most of it to the savings account.",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_subtitle": "There are several reasons why this is a good idea! First of all, because you want to save as much as possible and not spend everything.",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Smart, into your savings account!",
  "school_story_7.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Save All!",

  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_title": "Ett bankkort som du kanske hör på namnet, är ett kort som man får av sin bank.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_subtitle": "För att få ett kort behöver man ha ett speciellt konto hos den banken. Kortet är kopplat till det kontot.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Japp!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_title": "Because the debit card is connected to the account, the money is withdrawn from the account when you use it the store or online.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_subtitle": "But of course, someone needs to put the money into the account first, otherwise the balance will be 0!",

  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_title": "Jag har sagt det många gånger innan, att man ska veta sitt saldo. För det är viktigt på många sätt att hålla koll på pengar man får in och vad man spenderar.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Då undviker man att råka göra av med mer än vad man har och man har mer kontroll på sin ekonomi.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "And you will probably say it more times",

  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Nu har du lärt dig hur bankkortet fungerar. Då kan vi prata lite och det förbetalda kortet som fungerar ganska likt.",
