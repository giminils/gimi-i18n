  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can ask neighbors if you could help them for payment, but ask your parents first if they think it's okay!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "I get it!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Oh no I don't like waiting",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_subtitle": "If the headphones cost 1000pb normally, if you wait for a sale, maybe you can buy them for 700pb. Then you save 300pb! That's like, a visit to the movie theater + snacks!",

  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_title": "I know that this might be very simple for you but I wanted to explain it, just in case.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_subtitle": "Also to make you understand that when handling money you use math to count everything.",
  "school_story_5.1_screen_13_button_1_title": "Ok. I’ll do the challenge now.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_title": "Let's do some more on saving . I explained the math words previously. Because you need those things here.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "How?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_title": "You should never spend more than you have, right?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Right!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "Why?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_title": "This is where addition and subtraction comes in.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_subtitle": "I will use them to explain why you should not spend more money than you have.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Mmm... ok?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_title": "If you have those 5 apples, you only have 5 apples. Not more and not less.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can’t eat more than 5 apples, as you don't have any.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "Yup",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_4_button_2_title": "No, you can’t!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_title": "But if you have a card you pay with, you can sometimes spend more than you have in your bank account. Then you get a negative balance in your account.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_subtitle": "That is bad.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "Why is that bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_title": "It is bad because when you spend more than you have, you actually borrow money from the bank. Or somebody else.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_subtitle": "And loans cost money, like you would buy any other product or service.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_6_button_1_title": "Show me with math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_title": "Okay! So, you have 5pb. If you spend 7pb on a candy bar, that means you had to borrow 2pb from the bank.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_subtitle": "5 - 7 = -2",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "This is such easy math!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_title": "Then you don’t have any money left <italic>and</italic> you owe the bank 2pb. You might have to pay interest also.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_subtitle": "If you keep spending that way, you will sooner or later end up in debt.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Debt?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Sounds bad?",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_title": "By saving, you are adding instead of subtracting.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Of course spending is necessary, and something you have to do. But you should spend in a smart way.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "Sounds logical",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_10_button_2_title": "I want to know more!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_title": "One way of doing it, is to save up before the purchase.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Let's say you have the same 5pb from the previous example. You save 3pb every week for three weeks.\n5 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_11_button_1_title": "Looks right",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_title": "Now you have 14pb. If you want to buy that candy bar we talked about for 7pb, you have 7pb left after the purchase!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_subtitle": "You could buy the candy and have money over. Just because you waited with spending until you had saved up.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Saving seems nice!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "That does sound better",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_3_title": "I’m still confused",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_12_button_4_title": "But I don't like saving",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_title": "That is why saving is important. Spending more than you have can become expensive, and cause a lot of problems.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_subtitle": "Always making sure to have some money saved up is a real Financial Superskill!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_1_title": "I will try!",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_13_button_2_title": "Okay, I want Superskills",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_title": "Yup, so to summarize this destination's take-away message:",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_subtitle": "Saving is just putting away money. To let the money you have grow over time and earn and save more money than you spend.",
  "school_story_5.2_screen_14_button_1_title": "Got it!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_title": "Hey, good work on the challenge! I was actually just sitting and sorting the coins in my savings.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_subtitle": "I have done some recycling and helping out around my neighborhood, so I earned some money!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "I do that sometimes too",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_1_button_2_title": "I haven't earned any money yet...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_title": "Okay, well as you learned on the planet about earning, it's great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_subtitle": "I love saving money that I earn, then I can see it grow, almost like a plant!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_2_button_1_title": "It's good when money grows!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_title": "I have a savings goal now and can see how I get closer to reaching it, it feels great.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_subtitle": "I am trying to decide if I should save the money I earned..",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "What is the alternative?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "Buy gaming currency!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_title": "I have had my eye on a space scooter for a while now. It's like a regular scooter but with its own atmosphere.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_subtitle": "That means you don't have to wear a space suit while riding it! And it makes the coolest ”bluphbluph”-sound!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Sounds cool!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_title": "We can talk more about the scooter later, but now we will continue to talk about saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "Great, go!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "I want a space scooter too!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_title": "I previously explained that saving is important so that you don't have to spend more than you have because it is more expensive in the long run.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_subtitle": "But it’s also important because you get more money when you save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Get more money? I don’t get it",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Well yeah, if you save, you have money. Right?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_title": "Well actually, you get <bold>more</bold> money when you save! If you save your money in the bank, in a savings account, you earn interest. You can get more money by saving!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_subtitle": "Interest is a percentage that the bank pays you when you let them keep your money for a while.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_7_button_1_title": "Wait, the bank pays <bold>me</bold>?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_title": "Sure thing! The bank pays you money if you promise you will leave the money in the account for a while.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_subtitle": "This means that the longer ju keep the money in the account and the more you save there, the more money you get paid!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Sounds great!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_9_button_2_title": "That seems risky?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_title": "It’s not very risky, in savings accounts, banks guarantee that you will get paid back if the money would disappear.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_subtitle": "There are other ways to save where there is a risk of losing some, but you also have the chance to earn more money.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "I want to earn more, tell me how!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_title": "Let's wait a bit with those accounts, because there's a bit more you need to know before you are ready.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_subtitle": "There are many different ways to save, but generally they can be divided into long-term saving and short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okay, long-term and short-term",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_2_title": "🤑",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_3_title": "What is long-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_11_button_4_title": "What is short-term?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_title": "Let's start with short-term saving.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_subtitle": "The simplest way of short-term saving is just to put away your money, and try not to spend it.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Sounds too simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_12_button_2_title": "But that's kinda hard",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_title": "It can be pretty hard! But in that way you make sure that you have money for the things you really need or want.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Money disappears quickly when you buy a soda here, an ice cream there...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Yeah. I noticed!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_13_button_2_title": "I know, that's why I save!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_title": "Long-term saving as you might suspect, just means that you save for a long time.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_14_button_1_title": "Yup, simple",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_title": "How long you save for when you are saving long-term varies. But usually it’s for several years.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_subtitle": "A lot of people, for example, save for their retirement. That is when you get older and stop working. That means you save almost your entire life for that!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_1_title": "Wow, that's so long!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_15_button_2_title": "I have saved for years already",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_title": "The best way to do it, is to save both short-term and long-term.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_subtitle": "You could actually start saving long term already. Start saving for a driver's license or furniture that you will need when you move out of your parents house.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_16_button_1_title": "But wait, that's a very long time!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_title": "Yes, it might feel that way. But you only have to save a little every month. But because you save during a long time, it will be quite a lot of money anyway.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_subtitle": "Let's say you are 10 years old. If you just save 50pb a month, you would have 6000pb in total when you turn 18. The bank would give 1000pb just for saving in their bank. ",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_1_title": "Is that enough?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_2_title": "I save long term!",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_3_title": "SThat much?",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_17_button_4_title": "Maybe I should start...",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_title": "I have decided! I will save up money to buy that scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_subtitle": "I would love some chocolate right now but I won't buy any. I will save the money towards that space scooter.",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_1_title": "Sounds smart",
  "school_story_5.3_screen_18_button_2_title": "Sounds hard",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_1_subtitle": "I'm sitting here doing something...",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_1_button_1_title": "What's that Piggy?",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_title": "Transactions! When you check those, you can see the money you have spent and what you spent it on!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_subtitle": "You can also see what money that have come in, such as your allowence or gifts. It’s a list of your money going in and out.",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Why do you want to watch it?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_title": "Everyone who has a bank account or piggy bank in Gimi can do it!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_subtitle": "And I'm looking at my transactions to see what I bought this month. It's good to know!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "But, don’t you remember what you bought?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_title": "If I didn’t buy that much, I remember. But when I buy a lot of small things like sweets or drinks, it’s easy to quickly forget all purchases!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_subtitle": "If you check your transactions from time to time, you can see how much you have spent on different things.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Still don’t understand why you want to?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_5_button_2_title": "I usually watch!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_title": "Its good to do. If you save for something expensive and nice, for example, you do not want to spend too much.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_subtitle": "In your transactions, you may see that you have spent almost the entire weekly allowance on sweets. Or Robux. And then it takes longer before you can buy your expensive thing.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_1_title": "Yeah, okay",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_7_button_2_title": "But the money is already gone then!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_title": "If you keep track of what you spend, even if you look some time back, you can understand where the money went.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_subtitle": "And the next time you get allowance, it's easier to save more, because you're thinking about it! Smart, huh?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "Yeah that sounds smart",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_8_button_2_title": "Nothing new to me",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_title": "It was my first tip on what to think about when spending. Or when you have spent already!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_subtitle": "There are also some other things that are important to start thinking about early on, when you start managing your own money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "What Piggy? Where the nearest store is?",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_title": "Well, it can of course be very tempting to throw money around as soon as you get it, but on the planet on saving you learned why it is important to save.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_subtitle": "But you have to be able to shop too! If you shop smart, you can save a lot of money.",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Yes, shopping too!",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_10_button_2_title": "Ugh, I like saving more",
  "school_story_6.1_screen_11_title": "If you are good at earning, saving and spending money, then you have good personal finances. And the people who have a balance and a stable economy, feel much better than those who do not. ",

  "school_story_6.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "bye!",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_title": "You are back quickly! Hope it went well.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_subtitle": "Now let's talk a little bit about how to think when you want to buy things, or simply use your money.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Okay, go",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_title": "The big problem with money is that very few people and Piggy’s have large amounts of it.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_2_subtitle": "You only have a certain amount of money you get or earn, and if you don’t save, they run out. It's not just now it is like this it’s the same when you are an adult.",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_3_title": "The money that parents have is much more than you might get, when they get their salary. But they must also make it last for all the payments and things to buy.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_3_subtitle": "What is important then, is to choose wisely what you spend the money on.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "You can buy cheap food to save!",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_4_title": "If you are a smart shopper, you buy the most important things first. Then you are sure that yo have enough monay for what you need.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_4_subtitle": "Only when you have bought the most important things you can think about buying something you want. Especially before you know exactly how far the money will go.",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_5_title": "If you look at your transactions and learn about how much money you get and spend, you learn what to buy or not.",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_5_subtitle": "But you do not have to spend the money you have left after you buy the things you need. You can actually put it away as well. Save it!",

  "school_story_6.2_screen_7_subtitle": "If you work that way when you shop, you will be happy and satisfied in the long run too, because then you have everything you need. And some things you just want, too!",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Yes, that sounds good!",
  "school_story_6.2_screen_9_title": "To be a smart shopper, you need to know and understand that there is a difference between things you <bold>need</bold> and things you <bold>want</bold>.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_title": "Say for example if someone takes out a loan and buys a car, then the money will end up with the car company, which in turn can afford to give wages to those who work there and then the employees will then be able to afford to buy things for their salary and so on.",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_9_button_2_title": "I see a pattern",

  "school_story_7.1_screen_11_title": "If no one has the money to buy things, it will be the same thing but the opposite. Then shops may have to close instead or lay off staff because they can not afford it.",
