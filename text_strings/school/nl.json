  "school_story_4.3_screen_4_subtitle": "And you can ask neighbours if you could help them for payment, but ask your parents first if they think it's okay!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "I get it!",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_title": "It is! Sometimes that could save you a lot of money! And if you are patient and extra nifty, you will plan for a sale...",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_subtitle": "Either plan to buy the headphones during big sales, like Black Friday in November, or the Christmas sales.",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_1_title": "Oh no I don't like waiting",

  "school_story_4.3_screen_13_button_4_title": "I always do that!",
  "school_story_4.3_screen_14_title": "Because you made an effort while doing that, you can actually say you earned the money!",

  "school_story_9.1_screen_3_title": "Det kan vara svårt att förklara om man inte är tydlig med vad man pratar om. För man använder ordet ”spendera” på olika sätt.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_3_subtitle": "Man kan spendera tid, till exempel. Och du kan spendera sommaren på att vila hjärnan. Och såklart så spenderar man ju pengar.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_3_button_1_title": "Bra sätt att spendera sommaren på!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Jag gillar att använda hjärnan",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_title": "Och själva ordet spendera betyder ”att använda något med förståelsen att det kan ta slut”. Vilket är väldigt passande för just pengar!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_subtitle": "Om man bara spenderar pengar så kommer de ta slut. Det är just därför man tjänar och sparar också: för att kunna spendera pengar utan att de tar slut!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "Ja! Nu ser jag kopplingen!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_button_2_title": "Ah, förstår bättre nu",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_button_3_title": "Har jag vetat länge!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_4_button_4_title": "Ah, får tänka på detta",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_5_title": "Spenderar du dessutom smart, så kommer pengarna räcka ännu längre och till fler saker!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Så bra deal!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_6_title": "Vad man gör när man spenderar pengar är att man betalar för saker. Det kan vara att man köper produkter eller tjänster man vill ha, eller betalar räkningar.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_6_subtitle": "Därför tänkte jag att du behöver få veta om olika sätt att betala på och hur det fungerar.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_6_button_1_title": "Låter rimligt",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_8_title": "Idag är mycket av våra pengar digitala, och det gör att vi har massor av nya lösningar för hur man kan betala.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_8_subtitle": "Jag menar förutom de vanliga sätten med pengar eller med kort.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_8_button_1_title": "Vilka andra sätt?",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_title": "Jag kan nämna några. Du kan betala med appar och telefonen på flera sätt, som med Swish eller Apple Wallet.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_subtitle": "Och man kan ju till och med betala med en smartwatch!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ah, okej!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_button_2_title": "Visste inte det!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_button_3_title": "Japp!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_9_button_4_title": "Nu vill jag veta mer",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_title": "Har du tänkt på hur det fungerar egentligen? Var kommer pengarna du betalar med ifrån när du blippar din smartwatch i en kortmaskin?",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_button_1_title": "Oj nej, vet inte",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_button_2_title": "Visste inte ens man kunde det",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_button_3_title": "Jag har undrat det!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_10_button_4_title": "Bra fråga!",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_title": "Jo, alla dessa nya sätt att betala med baseras egentligen på de ”gamla vanliga” sätten att betala.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_subtitle": "Jag ska förklara hur det fungerar mer sen, men först får vi gå igenom de ”vanliga” sätten som jag kallar det.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_11_button_1_title": "Okej, rimligt",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_title": "När jag pratar om de vanliga sätten så menar jag att betala med pengar, eller olika slags kort.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_subtitle": "Att betala med pengar kan du redan. Men vet du hur det fungerar att betala med kort?",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ärligt, nej",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_button_2_title": "Pengar försvinner väl?",

  "school_story_9.1_screen_12_button_4_title": "Jag blir fattig",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_13_title": "Svaret är faktiskt att det är lite olika vad som händer. För det beror nämligen på vilken typ av kort du har. Se! Det är redan mer komplicerat än vad man tror.",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_13_subtitle": "Jag ska förklara mer om de vanligaste korten och hur det fungerar i nästa berättelse",
  "school_story_9.1_screen_13_button_1_title": "Okej, då kör jag utmaning nu",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_1_title": "Hoppas du är redo, för nu kör vi igenom de tre vanligaste korttyperna.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_1_subtitle": "De är: förbetalt kort, bankkort och kreditkort.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_1_button_1_title": "Jag är med!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_title": "Vi börjar med att prata om bankkortet. Det är det som används mest i de flesta länder.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_subtitle": "Och även det som du redan använder, eller snart får använda. För kreditkort t.ex. får man inte skaffa förrän man är 18.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_1_title": "Attans, kreditkort verkar häftigt",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_2_title": "Jag har ett bankkort",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_3_title": "Jag har inget än",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_2_button_4_title": "Jag har något slags kort",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_title": "Ett bankkort som du kanske hör på namnet, är ett kort som man får av sin bank.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_subtitle": "För att få ett kort behöver man ha ett speciellt konto hos den banken. Kortet är kopplat till det kontot.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_3_button_1_title": "Japp!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_title": "Eftersom bankkortet är kopplat till kontot, dras pengarna direkt därifrån när man använder det för att betala.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_subtitle": "Men någon behöver såklart betala in pengarna på kontot först, annars kommer ju saldot vara 0!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_4_button_1_title": "Mina föräldrar!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_title": "När du använder kortet i en kortmaskin i en affär, så kollar maskinen saldot på ditt konto först.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_subtitle": "Om du har tillräckligt med pengar så går köpet igenom och så dras de pengarna av från kontot.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_button_1_title": "Detta visste jag",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_5_button_2_title": "Jag visste inte detta",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_title": "Om man inte har tillräckligt med pengar för köpet på sitt konto, kommer det ett felmeddelande på kortmaskinen i affären...",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_subtitle": "Då står att det inte går att genomföra köpet. Då får man gå därifrån utan det man ville köpa.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_button_1_title": "Det har hänt mig!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_button_2_title": "Bra att veta!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_button_3_title": "Pinsamt att inte kunna betala",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_6_button_4_title": "Jag vet det här",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_title": "Vad tycker du verkar smart att göra för att slippa få felmeddelande och tvingas lämna tillbaka det du tänkt köpa?",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_1_title": "Ringa en förälder",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_2_title": "Kolla saldot innan",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_3_title": "Bara betala med kontanter",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_7_button_4_title": "Inget av alternativen",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_title": "Det bästa svaret är att hålla koll på saldot. Ett tips är att gå in i din bankapp eller din digitala spargris ofta för att kolla det.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_subtitle": "Om du handlar mycket så kan du kolla i alla fall varje kväll. På så sätt kan du enkelt förstå var dina pengar tar vägen och hur mycket du kan handla för.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_button_1_title": "Smart tips!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_9_button_2_title": "Ska tänka på det!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_title": "Jag har sagt det många gånger innan, att man ska veta sitt saldo. För det är viktigt på många sätt att hålla koll på pengar man får in och vad man spenderar.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_subtitle": "Då undviker man att råka göra av med mer än vad man har och man har mer kontroll på sin ekonomi.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_10_button_1_title": "Och du kommer säkert säga det fler gånger",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_title": "Jajemen! Det kommer jag att tjata om.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_subtitle": "Nu har du lärt dig hur bankkortet fungerar. Då kan vi prata lite och det förbetalda kortet som fungerar ganska likt.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_11_button_1_title": "Har nog hört om det",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_title": "Man betalar på samma sätt med ett förbetalt kort, men man har inget konto kopplat till kortet.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_subtitle": "Utan alla pengar måste läggas in på kortet innan man handlar. Man laddar det, som ett presenkort.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_button_1_title": "Smidigt!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_12_button_2_title": "Okej jag fattar",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_title": "Men den stora skillnaden är att man bara kan använda presentkort där du köpt det, men med det förbetalda kortet kan du handla nästan överallt.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_button_1_title": "Jag tror jag har ett sådant",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_13_button_2_title": "Jag hänger med!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_title": "Dessa två kort vi har pratat om hitills, det förbetalda kortet och bankkortet, är ganska lika i hur de fungerar. Att man måste ha pengar inna man handlar.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_subtitle": "Skillnaden är att på det förbetalda- ligger pengarna på kortet, och på bankkortet ligger pengarna på ens konto.",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_button_1_title": "Okej!",
  "school_story_9.2_screen_14_button_2_title": "Japp!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_title": "Hoppas det gick bra och att du fick öva lite på det du lärt dig!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_subtitle": "Det sista vi pratade om innan utmaningen var det förbetalda kortet.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_1_button_1_title": "Det verkar stämma!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_title": "Då har vi bara det sista kortet jag nämnde kvar. Kreditkortet.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_subtitle": "Har du koll på vad det är?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_1_title": "Självklart!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_2_title": "Vet inte",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_3_title": "Öh... Nä",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_2_button_4_title": "Lite koll",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_title": "Detta är ganska annorlunda från de två andra korten, eftersom man inte måste ha pengarna innan man handlar.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_button_1_title": "Det låter jättekonstigt",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_3_button_2_title": "Kan man bara handla på då?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_title": "När man handlar med kreditkortet, så dras inga pengar någonstans. Men alla köp man gör registreras.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_subtitle": "I slutet av månaden får man sedan en räkning, eller en faktura som det heter. Så betalar man alla köp på en gång.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_4_button_1_title": "Men var kommer pengarna ifrån?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_title": "Kreditkort är vad man kan kalla ett lån-kort. Om du köper något med ett kreditkort så lånar du egentligen pengar från banken eller ett företag.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_subtitle": "Då handlar man “på kredit”.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_button_1_title": "Det har jag koll på",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_5_button_2_title": "Nytt för mig",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_title": "Vi pratade lite om det redan på planeten ”spendera”.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_subtitle": "Man brukar ha en månad på sig att betala tillbaka pengarna utan att något händer. Betalar du inte tillbaka inom den tiden lägger banken, eller företaget, på en ränta.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_button_1_title": "Var inte ränta något man fick?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_6_button_2_title": "Just det, ränta kan man tjäna eller betala!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_title": "Ränta i detta fallet är ju kostnaden du betalar för att få låna pengarna från banken. Som jag nämnt innan så är ju att låna pengar en tjänst man får betala för.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_1_title": " 💳",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_2_title": "👍",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_3_title": "🏦",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_8_button_4_title": "💰",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_title": "Och handlar du för lånade pengar, måste du betala tillbaka både skulden <bold>och</bold> extra pengar i ränta.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_subtitle": "Vi provar ett exempel!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ett exempel är nog bra!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_title": "Du köper en jacka för 600kr och betalar med ett kreditkort. Du har inte råd att betala räkningen i tid, vilken gör att du blir skyldig en ränta.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_subtitle": "Räntan är 10% vilket i detta fallet blir 60kr. Hur mycket är du skyldig banken sammanlagt nu?",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_1_title": "6600kr",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_2_title": "460kr",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_3_title": "660kr",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_10_button_4_title": "420kr",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_title": "Rätt svar är 660kr.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_subtitle": "Det är skulden 600kr + räntan på 60kr. Du har på så sätt betalat 660 kr för jackan istället för 600kr.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_button_1_title": "Oj",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_11_button_2_title": "Förstod det",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_title": "Kreditkort kan fungera bra om man är väldigt noggrann med att betala i tid och inte handla mer än man har råd att betala tillbaka.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_subtitle": "Nu har du lite koll på kreditkort också, fast du inte kan använda ett på ett tag.",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_button_1_title": "Kul att veta!",
  "school_story_9.3_screen_12_button_2_title": "Jag vill ha ett nu...",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_title": "Du var duktig i utmaningen!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_subtitle": "Nu när du vet hur korten fungerar vill jag gå tillbaka till de andra nya metoderna från början av planeten.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_1_button_1_title": "Dom med appar och smartwatch?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_title": "Ja precis! Jag sparade dom tills nu, för även om de verkar vara nya eller annorlunda sätt att betala på så baseras de på de gamla.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_subtitle": "När du vill betala med Apple Wallet en smartwatch eller någon annan app så brukar man ju ”blippa” med telefonen eller klockan.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_button_1_title": "Japp!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_2_button_2_title": "Gör man?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_title": "Men för att det ska fungera så måste man först ha ett kort, och lägga in sina uppgifter från kortet.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_subtitle": "Så egentligen betalar man med sitt kort. Men genom att ”blippa” telefonen eller klockan.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_button_1_title": "Jahaa",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_3_button_2_title": "Men då är det ju typ samma",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_title": "Ja det är egentligen kortet man betalar med. Sen finns ju swish också, men det är annorlunda.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_subtitle": "Swish får man från sin bank. Och det är kopplat till ditt konto och ditt telefonnummer.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_4_button_1_title": "Okej, vänta. Förklara mer",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_5_title": "Banken kopplar ihop ditt konto hos dem med ditt telefonummer. När de gjort det, så fungerar Swishappen ungefär som ett bankkort.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_5_button_1_title": "Hurdå?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_title": "Jo, både Swish-appen och ett bankkort är kopplade till ditt konto. När du betalar med dessa så dras pengar från ditt konto.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_subtitle": "Detta görs genom att du använder kortet, eller med Swish används ditt telefonummer.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_6_button_1_title": "Kan ingen ta mina pengar då?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_title": "Det är ganska säkert, för att Swish ska fungera måste man identifiera sig med bank-id. Som bankkortets pinkod! ",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_subtitle": "Men man måste såklart skydda sitt bankid, som man ska göra med sin pinkod för att ingen ska kunna använda det.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_button_1_title": "Okej!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_7_button_2_title": "Tror jag fattar nu",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_title": "Som du har märkt vid det här laget, så finns det många ord att hålla reda på när det kommer till privatekonomi.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_subtitle": "Ibland kan ett ord betyda olika saker. Som ränta. Det kan ju både vara ränta man tjänar vid sparande, men också ränta man får betala för att låna pengar från banken.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_button_1_title": "Ibland är det stökigt",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_9_button_2_title": "Har ändå ganska bra koll",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_title": "Och en del ord betyder samma sak. Till exempel faktura och räkning.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_subtitle": "Det är just det vi ska prata om nu, men jag kommer bara använda ordet faktura.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_button_1_title": "Det visste jag väl!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_10_button_2_title": "Räkning och faktura är alltså samma sak!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_title": "En faktura är egentligen ett kontrakt på att man är skyldig pengar.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_subtitle": "Fakturor får man både hem i brevlådan, och digitalt. Det gäller att veta var de olika fakturorna man får hamnar så man inte missar dem.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_11_button_1_title": "Det är mycket man ska hålla koll på",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_title": "Ja visst är det? Men fakturor är inget du kan få förrän du är 18, men jag vill att du ska ha lite kunskap om dem ändå.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_subtitle": "Men var kommer fakturorna ifrån?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_button_1_title": "Ja, var?",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_12_button_2_title": "Jag vet!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_title": "Jo, det är ett sätt för betalning i efterhand, alltså inte direkt vid köpet. Såhär:",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_subtitle": "Du köper något och så får då en faktura. Och så behöver du först betala köpet det datumet som står på fakturan.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_button_1_title": "⏰",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_13_button_2_title": "🧠",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_title": "Det är ett väldigt smidigt sätt att betala för saker som man använder hela tiden. Som el! Tänk om du skulle få betala direkt varje gång du tänder en lampa eller laddar telefonen.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_button_1_title": "Det hade varit orimligt!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_14_button_2_title": "Det hade varit jobbigt",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_title": "Men man kan få fakturor för många olika saker. Produkter, tjänster och eller för kreditkort som vi pratade om.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_button_1_title": "Så för typ allt!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_15_button_2_title": "Oj, det trodde jag inte",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_16_title": "Nu har du lärt dig massor om olika betalmetoder. Man kan spendera utan att veta allt detta.",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_16_subtitle": "Men för att ha Superskills så vet man om alla metoder, och väljer den som passar bäst!",
  "school_story_9.4_screen_16_button_1_title": "Word, Piggy",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_1_title": "På planeten om sparande gick jag igenom grunderna till sparande och varför det är viktigt.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_1_subtitle": "Och som du vet finns det många sätt att spara på!",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_1_button_1_title": "I spargrisen",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_1_button_2_title": "I Gimi-appen",

  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_title": "Kommer du ihåg räntan du får betalt av banken för att spara? Den kallas ibland specifikt för sparränta och betalas ut en gång om året.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_subtitle": "Sparräntan är för det mesta ganska låg, ofta mellan 0 och 0,5%.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_button_1_title": "0% är ju ingenting!",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_button_2_title": "Jag kan inte räkna procent",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_button_3_title": "0,5% låter lite",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_3_button_4_title": "Okej",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_4_title": "Ja, det låter ju inte som mycket! Men ju mer pengar man sparar och ju längre man sparar dina pengar, desto mer får man ju i ränta!",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_4_subtitle": "Och man kan spara ganska mycket riskfritt om du minns.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_4_button_1_title": "Okej, kör!",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_5_title": "Jag lovade att du skulle få lära dig mer om att investera. Att investera är ett sätt att använda sina pengar på, ofta kallar man det för ett slags sparande.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_5_button_1_title": "Vänta, både spara och använda samtidigt?",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_6_title": "Ja, det är faktiskt både och! Har du hört någon säga “spara i aktier”?",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_6_button_1_title": "Ja det har jag nog",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_6_button_2_title": "Inte vad jag vet",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_7_title": "Man använder både orden spara och investera, för att man tar sina pengar och lägger undan dem i aktier. Men man använder dem också eftersom man måste köpa aktierna.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_7_button_1_title": "Men vad betyder investera?",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_9_title": "Investera är ett ord som betyder att man betalar pengar med förhoppning om att det ska ge en vinst, eller avkastning som det heter.",
  "school_story_10.1_screen_9_subtitle": "Det finns en risk, och ju mer man kan vinna desto större är risken. Men risken skulle vi prata mer om sen.",
